# App home

The [app home](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/admin/embedded-app-home) is the primary surface for merchants to interact with your app, providing access to data and UI rendering within the Shopify Admin. Using Polaris components and App Bridge, you can integrate using the Web Platform APIs you're already familiar with, making it easy to build and maintain performant apps on the Shopify platform.

## Getting started

To build for the App Home we recommend adding App Bridge and the Polaris Web Components to your application.

Polaris web components provide a consistent UI experience that matches the Shopify Admin while leveraging standard web platform features. To use these components in your app, you need to include the Polaris script in your application.

Apps that use these components can also include pre-built UI [patterns](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns) that are implemented using Polaris web components. These patterns help you quickly build consistent, familiar experiences for merchants that follow Shopify's design guidelines.

### New React Router Application

Start building your app fast with the Shopify CLI and the [Shopify React Router App template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-react-router). The CLI will set up App Bridge and the Polaris Web Components for you.

You will need to select:
 1. Select Build a React Router app (recommended)
 2. Select JavaScript OR TypeScript.

```shell
shopify app init

```


### Existing Remix Application

Add the Polaris Web Components script tag to your `app/root.tsx` file's `<head>`.

To use the Remix router you will need to control the custom event `shopify:navigate` and push that into `useNavigate`.

```jsx
import {useNavigate} from '@remix-run/react';

export default function App() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleNavigate = (event) => {
      const href = event.target.getAttribute('href');
      if (href) navigate(href);
    };

    document.addEventListener('shopify:navigate', handleNavigate);
    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('shopify:navigate', handleNavigate);
    };
  }, [navigate]);

  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        ...
        <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script>
      </head>
      ...
    </html>
  );
}

```


### Build your own way

When building your own way add the script tag right after the existing App Bridge script tag in your HTML head.

```html
<head>
  <meta name="shopify-api-key" content="%SHOPIFY_API_KEY%" />
  <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/app-bridge.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script>
</head>

```


## Your first API call

The following example uses [`Resource Picker`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/resource-picker) to open a UI component that enables users to browse, find, and select products from their store using a familiar experiences.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
  <meta name="shopify-api-key" content="%SHOPIFY_API_KEY%" />
  <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/app-bridge.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <button id="open-picker">Open resource picker</button>
  <script>
    document
      .getElementById('open-picker')
      .addEventListener('click', async () => {
        const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({type: 'product'});
        console.log(selected);
      });
  </script>
</body>

```


## TypeScript

Shopify App Bridge provides a companion npm library for TypeScript types, available at [`@shopify/app-bridge-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/app-bridge-types).

If you're using the [React library](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library#react), then the types package is already included.

Additionally, Shopify provides a companion npm library for Polaris web components types, available at [`@shopify/polaris-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/polaris-types).

### App Bridge Installation

The `@shopify/app-bridge-types` package can be installed using `yarn` or `npm`.

```shell
npm install --save-dev @shopify/app-bridge-types

```

```shell
yarn add --dev @shopify/app-bridge-types

```


### App Bridge Configuration

Adding the `@shopify/app-bridge-types` package to your `tsconfig.json` file will enable type checking for all files in your project.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@shopify/app-bridge-types"]
  }
}

```


### Polaris Web Components Installation

The `@shopify/polaris-types` package can be installed using `yarn` or `npm`. Specify `latest` in package.json if using https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js.

```shell
npm install --save-dev @shopify/polaris-types

```

```shell
yarn add --dev @shopify/polaris-types

```

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@shopify/polaris-types": "latest"
  }
}

```


### Polaris Web Components Configuration

Adding the `@shopify/polaris-types` package to your `tsconfig.json` file will enable type checking for all files in your project.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@shopify/polaris-types"]
  }
}

```


## Global variable

After App Bridge is set up in your app, you have access to the `shopify` global variable. This variable exposes various App Bridge functionalities, such as [displaying toast notifications](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/toast) or [retrieving app configuration details](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/config).

To explore all the functionality available on the `shopify` global variable:

1. Open the Chrome developer console while in the Shopify admin.
2. Switch the frame context to your app's `iframe`.
3. Enter `shopify` in the console.

## Direct API access

You can make requests to the Admin API directly from your app using the standard [web `fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)!

Any `fetch()` calls from your app to Shopify's Admin GraphQL API are automatically authenticated by default. These calls are fast too, because Shopify handles requests directly.

Direct API access is disabled by default. It can be [enabled](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/configuration#admin) in your app TOML file, along with whether you want to use direct API access with [online access](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/access-modes#online-access) or [offline access](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/access-modes#offline-access) mode.
```js
const res = await fetch('shopify:admin/api/2025-04/graphql.json', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `
      query GetProduct($id: ID!) {
        product(id: $id) {
          title
        }
      }
    `,
    variables: {id: 'gid://shopify/Product/1234567890'},
  }),
});

const {data} = await res.json();
console.log(data);

```

## App Nav

The `s-app-nav` component creates a navigation menu for your app. On desktop web browsers, the navigation menu appears as part of the app nav, on the left of the screen. On Shopify mobile, the navigation menu appears in a dropdown from the TitleBar. This is modeled after the [HTML nav element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav). Note that nested navigation items are not supported.
[View App Nav](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/app-bridge-web-components/app-nav)

## App Window

The `s-app-window` component displays a fullscreen modal window. It allows you to open up a page in your app specified by the `src` property. You can use this when you have larger or complex workflows that you want to display. The app window covers the entirety of the screen. The top bar of the app window is controlled by the admin and allows the user to exit if needed.
[View App Window](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/app-bridge-web-components/app-window)

## Forms

Enable automatic save bar integration for HTML forms by adding the `data-save-bar` attribute to your form element. When form data changes, a save bar automatically appears, prompting users to save or discard their changes.

Alternatively, use the global `shopify.saveBar` API for programmatic control over the save bar behavior. Programmatic control of the save bar is available as `shopify.saveBar.show()`, `shopify.saveBar.hide()`, and `shopify.saveBar.toggle()`.

**Note:** The save bar functionality requires the full App Bridge UI library to be loaded via a [script tag](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components).

## Examples

The `s-app-window` component displays a fullscreen modal window. It allows you to open up a page in your app specified by the `src` property. You can use this when you have larger or complex workflows that you want to display. The app window covers the entirety of the screen. The top bar of the app window is controlled by the admin and allows the user to exit if needed.

# Forms

Enable automatic save bar integration for HTML forms by adding the `data-save-bar` attribute to your form element. When form data changes, a save bar automatically appears, prompting users to save or discard their changes.

Alternatively, use the global `shopify.saveBar` API for programmatic control over the save bar behavior. Programmatic control of the save bar is available as `shopify.saveBar.show()`, `shopify.saveBar.hide()`, and `shopify.saveBar.toggle()`.

**Note:** The save bar functionality requires the full App Bridge UI library to be loaded via a [script tag](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components).

```html
<form data-save-bar>
  <s-text-field
    label="Product Title"
    name="title"
    required
  ></s-text-field>

  <s-text-area
    label="Description"
    name="description"
    rows="4"
  ></s-text-area>

  <s-text-field
    label="Price"
    name="price"
    type="number"
    step="0.01"
    min="0"
  ></s-text-field>
</form>

```

## Enable save bar on forms

Simply add `data-save-bar` to your `<form>` element:
```html
<form data-save-bar>
  <!-- Your form fields -->
</form>
```


### _FormElement

### data-discard-confirmation

value: `boolean`


### data-save-bar

value: `boolean`


### onreset

value: `(event: Event) => void`


### onsubmit

value: `(event: SubmitEvent) => void`

# Title bar

The admin title bar is a critical part of the Shopify Admin experience. It provides a way to display the current page title and actions for the user to take. This guide will show you how to work with the admin title bar using the App Bridge UI library.

```html
<s-page heading="Page Title">
  <s-button slot="primary-action" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Save')">Save</s-button>
  <s-button slot="secondary-actions" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Close')">Close</s-button>
  <s-button slot="secondary-actions" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Cancel')">Cancel</s-button>
</s-page>

```

## Use the s-page component

The `s-page` component is available for use in your app. It configures the title bar in the Shopify admin in addition to managing the page layout.
      Note that you do not need the full App Bridge UI library to use this component. You can still use `s-page` (and its required child components) in your app.

### SPageElement

### children

value: `SPageChildren`

  - SPageChildren: interface SPageChildren {
  primaryAction?: HTMLElement;
  secondaryActions?: HTMLElement[];
  breadcrumbActions?: HTMLElement;
}

### heading

value: `string`


### SPageChildren

### breadcrumbActions

value: `HTMLElement`


### primaryAction

value: `HTMLElement`


### secondaryActions

value: `HTMLElement[]`

## Examples

The admin title bar is a critical part of the Shopify Admin experience. It provides a way to display the current page title and actions for the user to take. This guide will show you how to work with the admin title bar using the App Bridge UI library.


### Basic title bar configuration

The `s-page` component accepts the following properties:
- `heading`: The heading for the page. This is the title of the page.

And the following slots:
- `primary-action`: The primary action for the page. This is the main action for the page.
- `secondary-actions`: The secondary actions for the page. This is a group of actions that are related to the page.
- `breadcrumb-actions`: The breadcrumb actions for the page. This is a link to the home page or the previous page.```html
<s-page heading="Page Title">
  <s-button slot="primary-action" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Save')">Save</s-button>
  <s-button slot="secondary-actions" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Close')">Close</s-button>
  <s-button slot="secondary-actions" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Cancel')">Cancel</s-button>
</s-page>

```


### Advanced title bar features

You can group secondary actions together using `s-menu` and the `commandfor` attribute. This will create a dropdown menu with the actions. The text content of the `s-button` used with the `commandfor` attribute will display a label for the group of actions.```html
<s-page heading="Page Title">
  <s-button slot="primary-action" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Save')">Save</s-button>
  <s-button slot="secondary-actions" commandfor="more-actions-id">More actions</s-button>
  <s-menu id="more-actions-id">
    <s-button onclick="shopify.toast.show('Action 1')">Action 1</s-button>
    <s-button onclick="shopify.toast.show('Action 2')">Action 2</s-button>
    <s-button onclick="shopify.toast.show('Action 3')">Action 3</s-button>
  </s-menu>
</s-page>

```

You can add breadcrumb actions using the `breadcrumb-actions` slot. This will add a link to the breadcrumb actions. You can use this to add a link to the home page or to add a link to the previous page.```html
<s-page heading="Page Title">
  <s-button slot="primary-action" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Save')">Save</s-button>
  <s-button slot="secondary-actions" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Cancel')">Cancel</s-button>
  <s-link slot="breadcrumb-actions" href="/">Home</s-link>
</s-page>

```

Here is a complete example of how to use the `s-page` component to interact with the admin title bar.```html
<s-page heading="Page Title">
  <s-button slot="primary-action" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Save')">Save</s-button>
  <s-button slot="secondary-actions" onclick="shopify.toast.show('Close')">Close</s-button>

## App

The App API provides information about the app and the status of its extensions.

> Tip:
> At this time, the App API only supports returning the activations on checkout and customer account UI extensions.
[View App](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/app)

## Config

The `config` API stores the initial configuration information for your app and lets you synchronously retrieve it.
[View Config](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/config)

## Environment

The Environment API provides utilities for information regarding the environment an App Home is running on.
[View Environment](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/environment)

## Resource Fetching

The `fetch` API allows you to send a fetch request that is authenticated with an [OpenID Connect ID Token](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/apis/id-token) from Shopify in the `Authorization` header. This is authenticated for your application domain and subdomains. See the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) documentation for more details.

 App Bridge injects automatic authorization into the global `fetch` function. While this is transparent and should not interfere with existing fetch code, this injection can be disabled using the [`disabledFeatures`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/apis/config#setting-config-values-disabledfeatures) configuration option. You will need to enable [Direct API access](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#admin) for your app to use this feature.
[View Resource Fetching](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/resource-fetching)

## ID Token

The ID token API asynchronously retrieves an [OpenID Connect ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken%5C) from Shopify that can be used to ensure that requests came from a Shopify authenticated user. See the [ID Token documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/session-tokens) from more information.
[View ID Token](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/id-token)

## Intents

The Intents API provides a way to invoke existing admin workflows for creating, editing, and managing Shopify resources.
[View Intents](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/intents)

## Loading

The Loading API indicates to users that a page is loading or an upload is processing.
[View Loading](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/loading)

## Modal API

The Modal API allows you to display an overlay that prevents interaction with the rest of the app until dismissed.
[View Modal API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/modal-api)

## Navigation

The Navigation API allows you navigate within and outside of your app using the [HTML anchor element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a). It also allows you to modify the top-level browser URL with or without navigating. It does this through the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) and the [Navigation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_API).
[View Navigation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/navigation)

## Picker

The Picker API provides a search-based interface to help users find and select one or more resources that you provide, such as product reviews, email templates, or subscription options, and then returns the selected resource `id`s to your app.

> Tip:
> If you are picking products, product variants, or collections, you should use the [Resource Picker](resource-picker) API instead.

[View Picker](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/picker)

## POS


  The POS API provides the ability to retrieve POS user, device, and location data, while also interacting with the cart and closing the app.

  > Tip:
  > It is recommended to use POS UI extensions for your development needs as they provide a faster, more robust, and easier to use solution for merchants using apps on POS. To learn more about the benefits and implementation details, refer to [POS UI Extensions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/pos/ui-extensions).
  
[View POS](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/pos)

## Print

The Print API allows you to print the content from your App Home on Shopify Mobile and Shopify POS devices.

 For more information, see the [Window `print()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/print) documentation.
[View Print](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/print)

## useAppBridge

The `useAppBridge` hook returns the `shopify` global variable to use App Bridge APIs such as `toast` and `resourcePicker`.
[View useAppBridge](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/useappbridge)

## Resource Picker

The Resource Picker API provides a search-based interface to help users find and select one or more products, collections, or product variants, and then returns the selected resources to your app. Both the app and the user must have the necessary permissions to access the resources selected.

> Tip:
> If you are picking app resources such as product reviews, email templates, or subscription options, you should use the [Picker](picker) API instead.
[View Resource Picker](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/resource-picker)

## Reviews


  The Reviews API allows you to request an app review modal overlaid on your embedded app in the Shopify admin. You control when to request a modal, but it will only be displayed to the merchant if [certain conditions](#rate-limits-restrictions) are met.
  
[View Reviews](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/reviews)

## Save Bar

The Save Bar API is used to indicate that a form on the current page has unsaved information. It can be used in 2 ways:

1. It is automatically configured when you provide the `data-save-bar` attribute to a [`form` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) and will display the save bar when there are unsaved changes. The [`submit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event) event fires when the form is submitted or when the Save button is pressed. The [`reset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reset_event) event fires when the form is reset or when the Discard button is pressed, which discards all unsaved changes in the form.
2. It can be controlled declaratively through the `ui-save-bar` element. For more information, refer to the [`ui-save-bar` component](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/web-components/ui-save-bar).
[View Save Bar](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/save-bar)

## Scanner

The Scanner API allows you to use the mobile device's camera to scan barcodes.
[View Scanner](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/scanner)

## Scopes

The Scopes API provides the ability to dynamically manage your access scopes within an embedded context.

  > Tip:
  > To learn more about declaring and requesting access scopes, as well as required vs. optional scopes, refer to [manage access scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/app-installation/manage-access-scopes).  
[View Scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/scopes)

## Share

The Share API allows you to invoke the "share sheet" to share content from your App Home on an iOS or Android device.

 For more information, see the [`navigator.share()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share) documentation. When using the `navigator.share()` method in an App Home, the `files` value within the `data` parameter is not supported.
[View Share](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/share)

## Support


  The Support API allows you to optionally register a custom handler when support requests are made directly through App Bridge. This interaction is triggered when a merchant clicks the get support button at the top of the app.

  > Tip:
  > To register a custom support callback, you must define a [Support link extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/distribution/support-your-customers#custom-support-events) and the link extension must point to a page within your app. This is to ensure consistent behavior when a merchant clicks a support button outside of the app. Without a support link extension, the support callback will be ignored.

## Toast

The Toast API displays a non-disruptive message that appears at the bottom of the interface to provide quick and short feedback on the outcome of an action. This API is modeled after the [Web Notification API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification).
[View Toast](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/toast)

## User

The User API lets you asynchronously retrieve information about the currently logged-in user.

The API returns a `Promise`, which contains user information, and the payload varies based on whether the user is logged into the Shopify admin or Shopify POS.
[View User](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/user)

## Web Vitals

The Web Vitals API allows you to access performance metrics for your app directly through App Bridge.
[View Web Vitals](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/apis/web-vitals)

# App

The App API provides information about the app and the status of its extensions.

> Tip:
> At this time, the App API only supports returning the activations on checkout and customer account UI extensions.

```js
const extensions = await shopify.app.extensions();

```

## Extensions method

The `app.extensions()` method asynchronously retrieves detailed information about the app's checkout and customer account extensions, including which targets they are activated on.

It returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `ExtensionInfo` objects. Each object contains the extension's handle and its activation targets. The array may be empty if the app has no extensions.

### ExtensionInfo

Contains the status information for the app's extension. This includes the extension's handle, and activation targets.

### activations

value: `ExtensionActivation[]`

  - ExtensionActivation: export interface ExtensionActivation {
  /**
   * The target identifier for the extension activation.
   */
  target: string;
}

# Environment

The Environment API provides utilities for information regarding the environment an App Home is running on.

```js
shopify.environment;
// => { mobile: false, embedded: true, pos: false }

```

## Environment

The `environment` API is available on the `shopify` global. It contains information about the current environment an App Home is running on.

### _EnvironmentApi

### embedded

value: `boolean`

Whether the app is embedded in the Shopify admin.

### mobile

value: `boolean`

Whether the app is running on Shopify Mobile.

### pos

value: `boolean`

Whether the app is running on Shopify POS.

# Resource Fetching

The `fetch` API allows you to send a fetch request that is authenticated with an [OpenID Connect ID Token](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/apis/id-token) from Shopify in the `Authorization` header. This is authenticated for your application domain and subdomains. See the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) documentation for more details.

 App Bridge injects automatic authorization into the global `fetch` function. While this is transparent and should not interfere with existing fetch code, this injection can be disabled using the [`disabledFeatures`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/apis/config#setting-config-values-disabledfeatures) configuration option. You will need to enable [Direct API access](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#admin) for your app to use this feature.

```js
fetch('/api/endpoint');

```

## Examples

The `fetch` API allows you to send a fetch request that is authenticated with an [OpenID Connect ID Token](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/apis/id-token) from Shopify in the `Authorization` header. This is authenticated for your application domain and subdomains. See the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) documentation for more details.

You will need to enable [Direct API access](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#admin) for your app to use this feature.


Fetch with custom headers

```js
fetch('/api/endpoint', {
  headers: {'accept-language': 'fr'},
});

```


Fetch directly from the Admin API using Direct API access

```js
const res = await fetch('shopify:admin/api/2025-04/graphql.json', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `
      query GetProduct($id: ID!) {
        product(id: $id) {
          title
        }
      }
    `,
    variables: {id: 'gid://shopify/Product/1234567890'},
  }),
});

const {data} = await res.json();
console.log(data);

```

# ID Token

The ID token API asynchronously retrieves an [OpenID Connect ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken%5C) from Shopify that can be used to ensure that requests came from a Shopify authenticated user. See the [ID Token documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/session-tokens) from more information.

```js
await shopify.idToken();

```

## ID Token

The `idToken` API is available on the `shopify` global. It asynchronously retrieves an OpenID Connect ID Token from Shopify.

### IdTokenApi

Asynchronously returns an ID token.

#### Returns: Promise<string>
() => Promise<string>


# Intents

The Intents API provides a way to invoke existing admin workflows for creating, editing, and managing Shopify resources.

```js
const activity = await shopify.intents.invoke('create:shopify/Collection');

const response = await activity.complete;

if (response.code === 'ok') {
  console.log('Collection created:', response.data);
}

```

## invoke

The `invoke` API is a function that accepts either a string query or an options object describing the intent to invoke and returns a Promise that resolves to an activity handle for the workflow.

## Intent Format

Intents are invoked using a string query format: `${action}:${type},${value}`

Where:
- `action` - The operation to perform (`create` or `edit`)
- `type` - The resource type (e.g., `shopify/Product`)
- `value` - The resource identifier (only for edit actions)

# Loading

The Loading API indicates to users that a page is loading or an upload is processing.

```js
shopify.loading(true);
// ...
shopify.loading(false);

```

## Loading API

The `Loading` API is available on the `shopify` global. It displays a loading indicator in the Shopify admin.

### LoadingApi

The `Loading` API provides a method to toggle the loading indicator in the Shopify admin.

#### Returns: void

#### Params:

- isLoading: boolean
(isLoading?: boolean) => void


# Modal API

The Modal API allows you to display an overlay that prevents interaction with the rest of the app until dismissed.

```html
<ui-modal id="my-modal">
  <p>Hello, World!</p>
</ui-modal>

<button onclick="shopify.modal.show('my-modal')">Open Modal</button>

```

## Modal

The `modal` API provides a `show` method to display a Modal, a `hide` method to hide a Modal, and a `toggle` method to toggle the visibility of a Modal. These are used in conjunction with the [`ui-modal` element](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/web-components/ui-modal). They are alternatives to the `show`, `hide`, and `toggle` instance methods.

### _ModalApi

### hide

value: `(id: string) => Promise<void>`

Hides the modal element. An alternative to the `hide` instance method on the `ui-modal` element.

### show

value: `(id: string) => Promise<void>`

# Picker

The Picker API provides a search-based interface to help users find and select one or more resources that you provide, such as product reviews, email templates, or subscription options, and then returns the selected resource `id`s to your app.

> Tip:
> If you are picking products, product variants, or collections, you should use the [Resource Picker](resource-picker) API instead.


```js
const picker = await shopify.picker({
  heading: 'Select a template',
  multiple: false,
  headers: [
    {content: 'Templates'},
    {content: 'Created by'},
    {content: 'Times used', type: 'number'},

# Print

The Print API allows you to print the content from your App Home on Shopify Mobile and Shopify POS devices.

 For more information, see the [Window `print()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/print) documentation.

```js
print();

```

# useAppBridge

The `useAppBridge` hook returns the `shopify` global variable to use App Bridge APIs such as `toast` and `resourcePicker`.

```jsx
import {useAppBridge} from '@shopify/app-bridge-react';

export function GenerateBlogPostButton() {
  const shopify = useAppBridge();

  function generateBlogPost() {
    // Handle generating
    shopify.toast.show('Blog post template generated');
  }

  return <button onClick={generateBlogPost}>Generate Blog Post</button>;
}

```

## useAppBridge hook

The `useAppBridge` hook is available for use in your app. It returns the `shopify` global or a proxy when not in a browser environment.

For more information, see the [global variable section](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library#shopify-global-variable) and the individual reference pages like [Toast](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/apis/toast) and [Resource Picker](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/apis/resource-picker).

# Resource Picker

The Resource Picker API provides a search-based interface to help users find and select one or more products, collections, or product variants, and then returns the selected resources to your app. Both the app and the user must have the necessary permissions to access the resources selected.

> Tip:
> If you are picking app resources such as product reviews, email templates, or subscription options, you should use the [Picker](picker) API instead.

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({type: 'product'});

```

## Resource Picker Options

The `Resource Picker` accepts a variety of options to customize the picker's behavior.

### ResourcePickerOptions

### action

value: `'add' | 'select'`

The action verb appears in the title and as the primary action of the Resource Picker.

### filter

value: `Filters`

  - Filters: interface Filters {
  /**

   * Whether to show product variants. Only applies to the Product resource type picker.
   * @defaultValue true
   */
  variants?: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether to show [draft products](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/details?shpxid=70af7d87-E0F2-4973-8B09-B972AAF0ADFD#product-availability).
   * Only applies to the Product resource type picker.
   * Setting this to undefined will show a badge on draft products.
   * @defaultValue true
   */
  draft?: boolean | undefined;
  /**
   * Whether to show [archived products](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/details?shpxid=70af7d87-E0F2-4973-8B09-B972AAF0ADFD#product-availability).

## Examples

The Resource Picker API provides a search-based interface to help users find and select one or more products, collections, or product variants, and then returns the selected resources to your app. Both the app and the user must have the necessary permissions to access the resources selected.

> Tip:
> If you are picking app resources such as product reviews, email templates, or subscription options, you should use the [Picker](picker) API instead.


Alternate resources

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({type: 'collection'});

```

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({type: 'variant'});

```


Preselected resources

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({
  type: 'product',
  selectionIds: [
    {
      id: 'gid://shopify/Product/12345',
      variants: [
        {
          id: 'gid://shopify/ProductVariant/1',
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      id: 'gid://shopify/Product/67890',
    },
  ],
});

```


Action verb

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({
  type: 'product',
  action: 'select',
});

```


Multiple selection

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({
  type: 'product',
  multiple: true,
});

```

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({
  type: 'product',
  multiple: 5,
});

```


Filters

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({
  type: 'product',
  filter: {
    hidden: true,
    variants: false,
    draft: false,
    archived: false,
  },
});

```


Filter query

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({
  type: 'product',
  filter: {
    query: 'Sweater',
  },
});

```


Selection

```js
const selected = await shopify.resourcePicker({type: 'product'});

if (selected) {
  console.log(selected);
} else {
  console.log('Picker was cancelled by the user');
}

```


Initial query

```js

# Reviews


  The Reviews API allows you to request an app review modal overlaid on your embedded app in the Shopify admin. You control when to request a modal, but it will only be displayed to the merchant if [certain conditions](#rate-limits-restrictions) are met.
  

```js
try {
  const result = await shopify.reviews.request();
  if (!result.success) {
    console.log(`Review modal not displayed. Reason: ${result.code}: ${result.message}`);
  }
  // if result.success *is* true, then review modal is displayed
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error requesting review:', error);
}

```

## Reviews

The Reviews API provides a `request()` method that allows you to request an app review modal.

### ReviewsApi

### request

value: `() => Promise<ReviewRequestResponse>`

  - ReviewRequestResponse: ReviewRequestSuccessResponse | ReviewRequestDeclinedResponse

### ReviewRequestSuccessResponse

### code

value: `'success'`


### message

value: `'Review modal shown successfully'`


### success

value: `true`


### ReviewRequestDeclinedResponse

### code

value: `ReviewRequestDeclinedCode`

  - ReviewRequestDeclinedCode: 'mobile-app' | 'already-reviewed' | 'annual-limit-reached' | 'cooldown-period' | 'merchant-ineligible' | 'recently-installed' | 'already-open' | 'open-in-progress' | 'cancelled'

### message

value: `string`


### success

value: `false`


# Save Bar

The Save Bar API is used to indicate that a form on the current page has unsaved information. It can be used in 2 ways:

1. It is automatically configured when you provide the `data-save-bar` attribute to a [`form` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) and will display the save bar when there are unsaved changes. The [`submit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event) event fires when the form is submitted or when the Save button is pressed. The [`reset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reset_event) event fires when the form is reset or when the Discard button is pressed, which discards all unsaved changes in the form.
2. It can be controlled declaratively through the `ui-save-bar` element. For more information, refer to the [`ui-save-bar` component](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/web-components/ui-save-bar).

```html
<form
  data-save-bar
  onsubmit="console.log('submit', new FormData(event.target)); event.preventDefault();"
>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input name="username" />
  </label>
</form>

```

## saveBar

The `saveBar` API provides a `show` method to display a save bar, a `hide` method to hide a save bar, and a `toggle` method to toggle the visibility of a save bar. These are used in conjunction with the `ui-save-bar` element. They are alternatives to the `show`, `hide`, and `toggle` instance methods.

### _SaveBarApi

### hide

value: `(id: string) => Promise<void>`

Hides the save bar element. An alternative to the `hide` instance method on the `ui-save-bar` element.

### leaveConfirmation

value: `() => Promise<void>`

Checks if saveBar is shown. This promise resolves if the save bar is not shown. Uses this method before navigating away from the page only when you have a custom routing that is not anchor tag.

### show

value: `(id: string) => Promise<void>`

Shows the save bar element. An alternative to the `show` instance method on the `ui-save-bar` element.

### toggle

value: `(id: string) => Promise<void>`

Toggles the save bar element visibility. An alternative to the `toggle` instance method on the `ui-save-bar` element.

### Save bar configured through the data-save-bar attribute

Subscribing to the [`HTMLFormElement: reset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reset_event) event```html
<form
  data-save-bar
  onreset="console.log('discarding')"
>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input name="username" />
  </label>
</form>

```

```html
<form data-save-bar>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input name="username" />
  </label>
</form>

<script>
  const form = document.querySelector('form');
  form.addEventListener('reset', (e) => {
    console.log('discarding');
  });
</script>

```

Subscribing to the [`HTMLFormElement: submit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reset_event) event```html
<form
  data-save-bar
  onsubmit="console.log('submitting');"
>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input name="username" />
  </label>
</form>

```

```html
<form data-save-bar>

  </label>
</form>

<script>
  const form = document.querySelector('form');
  form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
    console.log('submitting');
  });
</script>

```

Provide the `data-discard-confirmation` attribute to a `form` with the `data-save-bar` attribute to show a confirmation modal after the user clicks the Discard button of the save bar```html
<form
  data-save-bar
  data-discard-confirmation
  onsubmit="console.log('submit', new FormData(event.target)); event.preventDefault();"
>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input name="username" />
  </label>
</form>

```

Showing the save bar with the saveBar API```html
<ui-save-bar id="my-save-bar"></ui-save-bar>

<button onclick="shopify.saveBar.show('my-save-bar')">Show</button>
<button onclick="shopify.saveBar.hide('my-save-bar')">Hide</button>

# Share

The Share API allows you to invoke the "share sheet" to share content from your App Home on an iOS or Android device.

 For more information, see the [`navigator.share()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share) documentation. When using the `navigator.share()` method in an App Home, the `files` value within the `data` parameter is not supported.

```js
try {
  const shareData = {
    text: 'Learn more about Shopify App Bridge',
    url: 'https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge',
  };
  await navigator.share(shareData);
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Share error', err);
}

```

# Support


  The Support API allows you to optionally register a custom handler when support requests are made directly through App Bridge. This interaction is triggered when a merchant clicks the get support button at the top of the app.

  > Tip:
  > To register a custom support callback, you must define a [Support link extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/distribution/support-your-customers#custom-support-events) and the link extension must point to a page within your app. This is to ensure consistent behavior when a merchant clicks a support button outside of the app. Without a support link extension, the support callback will be ignored.
  

```js
// Define the callback function
const handler = () => {
  // implement your custom functionality
  openLiveChat();
};

// Register the callback
shopify.support.registerHandler(handler);

```

## Support

The Support API provides a registerHandler method that registers a handler to call when support is requested. It allows you to provide bespoke, in-app support such as opening a live chat widget.

### SupportApi

### registerHandler

value: `(callback: SupportCallback) => Promise<void>`

  - SupportCallback: () => void | Promise<void>

### SupportCallback

#### Returns: void | Promise<void>
() => void | Promise<void>

## Properties

### Avatar

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### alt

value: `string`

An alternative text that describes the avatar for the reader to understand what it is about or identify the user the avatar belongs to.

### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### initials

value: `string`

Initials to display in the avatar.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### size

value: `"small" | "small-200" | "base" | "large" | "large-200"`

Size of the avatar.

### src

value: `string`

The URL or path to the image.

Initials will be rendered as a fallback if `src` is not provided, fails to load or does not load quickly

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Properties

### Badge

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### color

value: `"base" | "strong"`

Modify the color to be more or less intense.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`

## Properties

### Banner

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### dismissible

value: `boolean`

Determines whether the close button of the banner is present.

When the close button is pressed, the `dismiss` event will fire, then `hidden` will be true, any animation will complete, and the `afterhide` event will fire.

### heading

value: `string`

The title of the banner.

### hidden

value: `boolean`

Determines whether the banner is hidden.

If this property is being set on each framework render (as in 'controlled' usage), and the banner is `dismissible`, ensure you update app state for this property when the `dismiss` event fires.

If the banner is not `dismissible`, it can still be hidden by setting this property.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### tone

value: `"info" | "success" | "warning" | "critical" | "auto"`

Sets the tone of the Banner, based on the intention of the information being conveyed.

The banner is a live region and the type of status will be dictated by the Tone selected.

- `critical` creates an [assertive live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role) that is announced by screen readers immediately.
- `neutral`, `info`, `success`, `warning` and `caution` creates an [informative live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/status_role) that is announced by screen readers after the current message.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

# Box

A generic container that provides a flexible alternative for custom designs not achievable with existing components. Use it to apply styling such as backgrounds, padding, or borders, or to nest and group other components. The contents of Box always maintain their natural size, making it especially useful within layout components that would otherwise stretch their children.

```jsx
<>
  <s-box padding="base">Available for iPad, iPhone, and Android.</s-box>

  <s-box padding="base" background="subdued" border="base" borderRadius="base">

## Properties

### Box

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the element. When set, it will be announced to users using assistive technologies and will provide them with more context.

Only use this when the element's content is not enough context for users using assistive technologies.

### accessibilityRole

value: `AccessibilityRole`

  - AccessibilityRole: 'main' | 'header' | 'footer' | 'section' | 'aside' | 'navigation' | 'ordered-list' | 'list-item' | 'list-item-separator' | 'unordered-list' | 'separator' | 'status' | 'alert' | 'generic' | 'presentation' | 'none'
Sets the semantic meaning of the component’s content. When set, the role will be used by assistive technologies to help users navigate the page.

### accessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "hidden" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the element.

- `visible`: the element is visible to all users.
- `hidden`: the element is removed from the accessibility tree but remains visible.
- `exclusive`: the element is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### background

value: `BackgroundColorKeyword`

  - BackgroundColorKeyword: 'transparent' | ColorKeyword
  - ColorKeyword: 'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
Adjust the background of the component.

### blockSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrAuto`

  - SizeUnitsOrAuto: SizeUnits | 'auto'
  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [block size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/block-size).

### border

value: `BorderShorthand`

  - BorderShorthand: BorderSizeKeyword | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword}` | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword} ${BorderStyleKeyword}`
Set the border via the shorthand property.

This can be a size, optionally followed by a color, optionally followed by a style.

If the color is not specified, it will be `base`.

If the style is not specified, it will be `auto`.

Values can be overridden by `borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, and `borderColor`.

### borderColor

value: `"" | ColorKeyword`

  - ColorKeyword: 'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
Adjust the color of the border.

### borderRadius

value: `MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<BoxBorderRadii>`

  - Box: declare class Box extends BoxElement implements BoxProps {
  constructor();
}
  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - BoxBorderRadii: 'small' | 'small-200' | 'small-100' | 'base' | 'large' | 'large-100' | 'large-200' | 'none'
Adjust the radius of the border.

### borderStyle

value: `"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<BoxBorderStyles>`

  - Box: declare class Box extends BoxElement implements BoxProps {
  constructor();
}
  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - BoxBorderStyles: 'auto' | 'none' | 'solid' | 'dashed'
Adjust the style of the border.

### borderWidth

value: `"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<"small" | "small-100" | "base" | "large" | "large-100" | "none">`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
Adjust the width of the border.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### display

value: `MaybeResponsive<"auto" | "none">`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
Sets the outer [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) type of the component. The outer type sets a component's participation in [flow layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout).

- `auto` the component's initial value. The actual value depends on the component and context.
- `none` hides the component from display and removes it from the accessibility tree, making it invisible to screen readers.

### inlineSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrAuto`

  - SizeUnitsOrAuto: SizeUnits | 'auto'
  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inline-size).

### maxBlockSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrNone`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
  - SizeUnitsOrNone: SizeUnits | 'none'

### minBlockSize

value: `SizeUnits`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [minimum block size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-block-size).

### minInlineSize

value: `SizeUnits`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [minimum inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-inline-size).

### overflow

value: `"visible" | "hidden"`

Sets the overflow behavior of the element.

- `hidden`: clips the content when it is larger than the element’s container. The element will not be scrollable and the users will not be able to access the clipped content by dragging or using a scroll wheel on a mouse.
- `visible`: the content that extends beyond the element’s container is visible.

### padding

value: `MaybeResponsive<MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the padding of all edges.

[1-to-4-value syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties#edges_of_a_box) is supported. Note that, contrary to the CSS, it uses flow-relative values and the order is:

- 4 values: `block-start inline-end block-end inline-start`
- 3 values: `block-start inline block-end`
- 2 values: `block inline`

For example:
- `large` means block-start, inline-end, block-end and inline-start paddings are `large`.
- `large none` means block-start and block-end paddings are `large`, inline-start and inline-end paddings are `none`.
- `large none large` means block-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`, block-end padding is `large` and inline-start padding is `none`.
- `large none large small` means block-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`, block-end padding is `large` and inline-start padding is `small`.

A padding value of `auto` will use the default padding for the closest container that has had its usual padding removed.

`padding` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingBlock

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
  - MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}`
Adjust the block-padding.

- `large none` means block-start padding is `large`, block-end padding is `none`.

This overrides the block value of `padding`.

`paddingBlock` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingBlockEnd

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the block-end padding.

This overrides the block-end value of `paddingBlock`.

`paddingBlockEnd` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingBlockStart

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the block-start padding.

This overrides the block-start value of `paddingBlock`.

`paddingBlockStart` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingInline

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
  - MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}`
Adjust the inline padding.

- `large none` means inline-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`.

This overrides the inline value of `padding`.

`paddingInline` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingInlineEnd

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

## Examples

A generic container that provides a flexible alternative for custom designs not achievable with existing components. Use it to apply styling such as backgrounds, padding, or borders, or to nest and group other components. The contents of Box always maintain their natural size, making it especially useful within layout components that would otherwise stretch their children.


### Basic usage

Demonstrates creating a simple container with padding, base background, border, and rounded corners to group and highlight product information.```jsx
<s-box
  padding="base"
  background="base"
  borderWidth="base"
  borderColor="base"
  borderRadius="base"
>
  <s-paragraph>Product information</s-paragraph>
</s-box>

```

```html
<s-box
  padding="base"
  background="base"
  borderWidth="base"
  borderColor="base"
  borderRadius="base"
>
  <s-paragraph>Product information</s-paragraph>
</s-box>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-box
  padding="base"
  background="base"
  borderWidth="base"
  borderColor="base"
  borderRadius="base"
>
  <s-paragraph>Product information</s-paragraph>
</s-box>
) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Illustrates using a box with responsive padding to create an adaptable container for shipping information that can adjust to different screen or container sizes.```jsx
<s-query-container>
  <s-box
    padding="@container (inline-size > 400px) base, large-200"
    background="base"
    borderWidth="base"
    borderColor="base"
  >
    <s-text>Your order will be processed within 2-3 business days</s-text>
  </s-box>
</s-query-container>
```

```html
<s-query-container>
  <s-box
    padding="@container (inline-size > 400px) base, large-200"
    background="base"
    borderWidth="base"
    borderColor="base"
  >
    <s-paragraph>Your order will be processed within 2-3 business days</s-paragraph>
  </s-box>
</s-query-container>
```

### BoxSlots

### children

value: `HTMLElement`

The content of the Box.

## Examples

A generic container that provides a flexible alternative for custom designs not achievable with existing components. Use it to apply styling such as backgrounds, padding, or borders, or to nest and group other components. The contents of Box always maintain their natural size, making it especially useful within layout components that would otherwise stretch their children.


### Basic usage

  background="base"
  borderWidth="base"
  borderColor="base"
  borderRadius="base"
>

```

```html

</s-box>

```

# Button

Triggers actions or events, such as submitting forms, opening dialogs, or navigating to other pages. Use Button to let users perform specific tasks or initiate interactions throughout the interface. Buttons can also function as links, guiding users to internal or external destinations.

```jsx
<>
  <s-button variant="primary">Add Product</s-button>
  <s-button variant="secondary">Save Theme</s-button>
</>
```

```html
<s-button variant="primary">Add Product</s-button>

```

## Properties

### Button

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the Button. It will be read to users using assistive technologies such as screen readers.

Use this when using only an icon or the Button text is not enough context for users using assistive technologies.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### command

value: `'--auto' | '--show' | '--hide' | '--toggle'`

Sets the action the [command](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#command) should take when this clickable is activated.

See the documentation of particular components for the actions they support.

- `--auto`: a default action for the target component.
- `--show`: shows the target component.
- `--hide`: hides the target component.
- `--toggle`: toggles the target component.

### commandFor

value: `string`

Sets the element the [commandFor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#commandfor) should act on when this clickable is activated.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the Button meaning it cannot be clicked or receive focus.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### download

value: `string`

Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download with the string being the file name. Download only works for same-origin URLs or the `blob:` and `data:` schemes.

### href

value: `string`

The URL to link to.

- If set, it will navigate to the location specified by `href` after executing the `click` event.
- If a `commandFor` is set, the `command` will be executed instead of the navigation.

"viewport-tall" | "viewport-wide" | "wallet" | "wand" | "watch" | "wifi" | "work" | "work-list" | "wrench" | "x" | "x-circle" | "x-circle-filled"`

The type of icon to be displayed in the Button.

### interestFor

value: `string`

Sets the element the [interestFor](https://open-ui.org/components/interest-invokers.explainer/#the-pitch-in-code) should act on when this clickable is activated.

### loading

value: `boolean`

Replaces content with a loading indicator while a background action is being performed.

This also disables the Button.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### target

value: `"auto" | AnyString | "_blank" | "_self" | "_parent" | "_top"`

  - AnyString: string & {}
Specifies where to display the linked URL.

### tone

value: `"critical" | "auto" | "neutral"`

Sets the tone of the Button based on the intention of the information being conveyed.

### type

value: `"button" | "reset" | "submit"`

The behavior of the Button.

- `submit`: Used to indicate the component acts as a submit button, meaning it submits the closest form.
- `button`: Used to indicate the component acts as a button, meaning it has no default action.
- `reset`: Used to indicate the component acts as a reset button, meaning it resets the closest form (returning fields to their default values).

This property is ignored if the component supports `href` or `commandFor`/`command` and one of them is set.

### variant

value: `"auto" | "primary" | "secondary" | "tertiary"`

Changes the visual appearance of the Button.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Triggers actions or events, such as submitting forms, opening dialogs, or navigating to other pages. Use Button to let users perform specific tasks or initiate interactions throughout the interface. Buttons can also function as links, guiding users to internal or external destinations.


### Basic usage

Demonstrates a simple button with default styling, automatically determining its visual variant and using a clear, action-oriented label.```jsx
<s-button>Save</s-button>
```

```html
<s-button>Save</s-button>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-button>Save</s-button>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Showcases different button variants with varying visual emphasis, helping merchants understand action priorities through distinct styling.```jsx
<s-stack direction="inline" gap="base">
  <s-button variant="primary">Primary</s-button>
  <s-button variant="secondary">Secondary</s-button>
  <s-button variant="tertiary">Tertiary</s-button>
  <s-button variant="auto">Auto</s-button>
</s-stack>
```

```html
<s-stack direction="inline" gap="base">
  <s-button variant="primary">Primary</s-button>
  <s-button variant="secondary">Secondary</s-button>
  <s-button variant="tertiary">Tertiary</s-button>
  <s-button variant="auto">Auto</s-button>

## Properties

### ButtonGroup

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

Label for the button group that describes the content of the group for screen reader users to understand what's included.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### gap

value: `"base" | "none"`

The gap between elements.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Displays multiple buttons in a layout.

## Properties

### Checkbox

### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label used for users using assistive technologies like screen readers. When set, any children or `label` supplied will not be announced. This can also be used to display a control without a visual label, while still providing context to users using screen readers.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### checked

value: `boolean`

Whether the control is active.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultChecked

value: `boolean`

Whether the control is active by default.

### defaultIndeterminate

value: `boolean`


### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### indeterminate

value: `boolean`


### label

value: `string`

Visual content to use as the control label.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The value used in form data when the checkbox is checked.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Give users a clear way to make selections, such as agreeing to terms or choosing multiple items from a list.

const toggleAll = (checked) => setSelectedItems(checked ? items : []);
const isSelected = (item) => selectedItems.includes(item);

return (

## Examples

Give users a clear way to make selections, such as agreeing to terms or choosing multiple items from a list.


### Basic usage

Checkbox in indeterminate state, commonly used for "select all" functionality when some items are selected.```jsx
const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState([]);
const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];

const toggleItem = (value, checked) => setSelectedItems(checked ? [...selectedItems, value] : selectedItems.filter(item => item !== value));
const toggleAll = (checked) => setSelectedItems(checked ? items : []);
const isSelected = (item) => selectedItems.includes(item);

return (
  <s-stack gap="small">
    <s-checkbox
      label="Select all items"
      indeterminate={selectedItems.length !== 0 && selectedItems.length !== items.length}
      checked={selectedItems.length === items.length}
      onChange={e => toggleAll(e.currentTarget.checked)}
    />
    <s-divider />
    {items.map(i => (
      <s-checkbox key={i} label={i} checked={isSelected(i)} onChange={e => toggleItem(i, e.currentTarget.checked)} />
    ))}
  </s-stack>
);
```

## Properties

### Chip

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the Chip. It will be read to users using assistive technologies such as screen readers.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### color

value: `ColorKeyword`

  - ColorKeyword: 'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
Modify the color to be more or less intense.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Properties

### ChoiceList

### __@internals$3@6794

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

`disabled` on any child choices is ignored when this is true.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### multiple

value: `boolean`

Whether multiple choices can be selected.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### values

value: `string[]`

An array of the `value`s of the selected options.

This is a convenience prop for setting the `selected` prop on child options.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Present multiple options to users, allowing either single selections with radio buttons or multiple selections with checkboxes.

## Choice

Create options that let users select one or multiple items from a list of choices.

### Choice

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label used for users using assistive technologies like screen readers. When set, any children or `label` supplied will not be announced. This can also be used to display a control without a visual label, while still providing context to users using screen readers.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultSelected

value: `boolean`

Whether the control is active by default.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the control, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### selected

value: `boolean`

Whether the control is active.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The value used in form data when the control is checked.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Present multiple options to users, allowing either single selections with radio buttons or multiple selections with checkboxes.

# Clickable

A generic interactive container component that provides a flexible alternative for custom interactive elements not achievable with existing components like Button or Link. Use it to apply specific styling such as backgrounds, padding, or borders.

```jsx
<>
  <s-clickable padding="base">Create Store</s-clickable>

  <s-clickable
    border="base"
    padding="base"
    background="subdued"
    borderRadius="base"

## Properties

### Clickable

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the element. When set, it will be announced to users using assistive technologies and will provide them with more context.

Only use this when the element's content is not enough context for users using assistive technologies.

### accessibilityRole

value: `AccessibilityRole`

  - AccessibilityRole: 'main' | 'header' | 'footer' | 'section' | 'aside' | 'navigation' | 'ordered-list' | 'list-item' | 'list-item-separator' | 'unordered-list' | 'separator' | 'status' | 'alert' | 'generic' | 'presentation' | 'none'
Sets the semantic meaning of the component’s content. When set, the role will be used by assistive technologies to help users navigate the page.

### accessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "hidden" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the element.

- `visible`: the element is visible to all users.
- `hidden`: the element is removed from the accessibility tree but remains visible.
- `exclusive`: the element is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### background

value: `BackgroundColorKeyword`

  - BackgroundColorKeyword: 'transparent' | ColorKeyword
  - ColorKeyword: 'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
Adjust the background of the component.

### blockSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrAuto`

  - SizeUnitsOrAuto: SizeUnits | 'auto'
  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [block size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/block-size).

### border

value: `BorderShorthand`

  - BorderShorthand: BorderSizeKeyword | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword}` | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword} ${BorderStyleKeyword}`
Set the border via the shorthand property.

This can be a size, optionally followed by a color, optionally followed by a style.

If the color is not specified, it will be `base`.

If the style is not specified, it will be `auto`.

Values can be overridden by `borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, and `borderColor`.

### borderColor

value: `"" | ColorKeyword`

  - ColorKeyword: 'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
Adjust the color of the border.

### borderRadius

value: `MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<BoxBorderRadii>`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - BoxBorderRadii: 'small' | 'small-200' | 'small-100' | 'base' | 'large' | 'large-100' | 'large-200' | 'none'
Adjust the radius of the border.

### borderStyle

value: `"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<BoxBorderStyles>`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - BoxBorderStyles: 'auto' | 'none' | 'solid' | 'dashed'
Adjust the style of the border.

### borderWidth

value: `"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<"small" | "small-100" | "base" | "large" | "large-100" | "none">`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
Adjust the width of the border.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### command

value: `'--auto' | '--show' | '--hide' | '--toggle'`

Sets the action the [command](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#command) should take when this clickable is activated.

See the documentation of particular components for the actions they support.

- `--auto`: a default action for the target component.
- `--show`: shows the target component.
- `--hide`: hides the target component.
- `--toggle`: toggles the target component.

### commandFor

value: `string`

Sets the element the [commandFor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#commandfor) should act on when this clickable is activated.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the clickable, meaning it cannot be clicked or receive focus.

In this state, onClick will not fire. If the click event originates from a child element, the event will immediately stop propagating from this element.

However, items within the clickable can still receive focus and be interacted with.

This has no impact on the visual state by default, but developers are encouraged to style the clickable accordingly.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### display

value: `MaybeResponsive<"auto" | "none">`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
Sets the outer [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) type of the component. The outer type sets a component's participation in [flow layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout).

- `auto` the component's initial value. The actual value depends on the component and context.
- `none` hides the component from display and removes it from the accessibility tree, making it invisible to screen readers.

### download

value: `string`

Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download with the string being the file name. Download only works for same-origin URLs or the `blob:` and `data:` schemes.

### href

value: `string`

The URL to link to.

- If set, it will navigate to the location specified by `href` after executing the `click` event.
- If a `commandFor` is set, the `command` will be executed instead of the navigation.

### inlineSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrAuto`

  - SizeUnitsOrAuto: SizeUnits | 'auto'
  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inline-size).

### interestFor

value: `string`

Sets the element the [interestFor](https://open-ui.org/components/interest-invokers.explainer/#the-pitch-in-code) should act on when this clickable is activated.

### loading

value: `boolean`

Disables the clickable, and indicates to assistive technology that the loading is in progress.

This also disables the clickable.

### maxBlockSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrNone`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
  - SizeUnitsOrNone: SizeUnits | 'none'
Adjust the [maximum block size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-block-size).

### maxInlineSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrNone`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
  - SizeUnitsOrNone: SizeUnits | 'none'
Adjust the [maximum inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-inline-size).

### minBlockSize

value: `SizeUnits`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [minimum block size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-block-size).

### minInlineSize

value: `SizeUnits`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [minimum inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-inline-size).

### overflow

value: `"visible" | "hidden"`

Sets the overflow behavior of the element.

- `hidden`: clips the content when it is larger than the element’s container. The element will not be scrollable and the users will not be able to access the clipped content by dragging or using a scroll wheel on a mouse.
- `visible`: the content that extends beyond the element’s container is visible.

### padding

value: `MaybeResponsive<MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the padding of all edges.

[1-to-4-value syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties#edges_of_a_box) is supported. Note that, contrary to the CSS, it uses flow-relative values and the order is:

- 4 values: `block-start inline-end block-end inline-start`
- 3 values: `block-start inline block-end`
- 2 values: `block inline`

For example:
- `large` means block-start, inline-end, block-end and inline-start paddings are `large`.
- `large none` means block-start and block-end paddings are `large`, inline-start and inline-end paddings are `none`.
- `large none large` means block-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`, block-end padding is `large` and inline-start padding is `none`.
- `large none large small` means block-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`, block-end padding is `large` and inline-start padding is `small`.

A padding value of `auto` will use the default padding for the closest container that has had its usual padding removed.

`padding` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingBlock

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
  - MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}`
Adjust the block-padding.

- `large none` means block-start padding is `large`, block-end padding is `none`.

This overrides the block value of `padding`.

`paddingBlock` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingBlockEnd

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the block-end padding.

This overrides the block-end value of `paddingBlock`.

`paddingBlockEnd` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingBlockStart

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the block-start padding.

This overrides the block-start value of `paddingBlock`.

`paddingBlockStart` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingInline

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
  - MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}`
Adjust the inline padding.

- `large none` means inline-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`.

This overrides the inline value of `padding`.

`paddingInline` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingInlineEnd

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the inline-end padding.

This overrides the inline-end value of `paddingInline`.

`paddingInlineEnd` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingInlineStart

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### target

value: `"auto" | AnyString | "_blank" | "_self" | "_parent" | "_top"`

  - AnyString: string & {}
Specifies where to display the linked URL.

### type

value: `"button" | "reset" | "submit"`

- `submit`: Used to indicate the component acts as a submit button, meaning it submits the closest form.
- `button`: Used to indicate the component acts as a button, meaning it has no default action.
- `reset`: Used to indicate the component acts as a reset button, meaning it resets the closest form (returning fields to their default values).

This property is ignored if the component supports `href` or `commandFor`/`command` and one of them is set.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;

## Examples

A generic interactive container component that provides a flexible alternative for custom interactive elements not achievable with existing components like Button or Link. Use it to apply specific styling such as backgrounds, padding, or borders.


### Basic usage

A simple clickable button with a base border and padding, demonstrating the default button behavior of the Clickable component.```jsx
<s-clickable border="base" padding="base">
  Click me
</s-clickable>
```

```html
<s-clickable border="base" padding="base">Click me</s-clickable>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-clickable border="base" padding="base">
  Click me
</s-clickable>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Demonstrates the Clickable component's ability to function as a link, opening the specified URL in a new browser tab when clicked.```jsx
<s-clickable href="javascript:void(0)" target="_blank">
  Visit Shopify
</s-clickable>
```

```html
<s-clickable href="javascript:void(0)" target="_blank">
  Visit Shopify
</s-clickable>

```

```preview

    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

A disabled submit button that can be used within a form, showing the component's form integration capabilities and disabled state.```jsx
<s-clickable type="submit" disabled border="base" padding="base">
  Save changes
</s-clickable>
```

```html
<s-clickable type="submit" disabled border="base" padding="base">
  Save changes
</s-clickable>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>

## Properties

### ClickableChip

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the Chip. It will be read to users using assistive technologies such as screen readers.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### color

value: `ColorKeyword`

  - ColorKeyword: 'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
Modify the color to be more or less intense.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the chip, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### hidden

value: `boolean`

Determines whether the chip is hidden.

If this property is being set on each framework render (as in 'controlled' usage), and the chip is `removable`, ensure you update app state for this property when the `remove` event fires.

If the chip is not `removable`, it can still be hidden by setting this property.

### href

value: `string`

The URL to link to.

- If set, it will navigate to the location specified by `href` after executing the `click` event.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### removable

value: `boolean`

Whether the chip is removable.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Properties

### ColorField

### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### alpha

value: `boolean`

Allow user to select an alpha value.

### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### autocomplete

value: `"on" | "off"`

A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### setInternalValue

value: `(value: string, normalize: boolean) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Allow users to select a color with a color picker or as a text input.

## Properties

### ColorPicker

### __@internals$2@6897

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### alpha

value: `boolean`

Allow user to select an alpha value.

### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The currently selected color.

Supported formats include:
- HSL

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Allow users to select a color from a color palette.

## Properties

### DateField

### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### allow

value: `string`

Dates that can be selected.

A comma-separated list of dates, date ranges. Whitespace is allowed after commas.

The default `''` allows all dates.

- Dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format allow a single date.
- Dates in `YYYY-MM` format allow a whole month.
- Dates in `YYYY` format allow a whole year.
- Ranges are expressed as `start--end`.     - Ranges are inclusive.
    - If either `start` or `end` is omitted, the range is unbounded in that direction.
    - If parts of the date are omitted for `start`, they are assumed to be the minimum possible value.
      So `2024--` is equivalent to `2024-01-01--`.
    - If parts of the date are omitted for `end`, they are assumed to be the maximum possible value.
      So `--2024` is equivalent to `--2024-12-31`.
    - Whitespace is allowed either side of `--`.

### allowDays

value: `string`

Days of the week that can be selected. These intersect with the result of `allow` and `disallow`.

A comma-separated list of days. Whitespace is allowed after commas.

The default `''` has no effect on the result of `allow` and `disallow`.

Days are `sunday`, `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`.

### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### autocomplete

value: `DateAutocompleteField`

  - DateAutocompleteField: 'bday-day' | 'bday-month' | 'bday-year' | 'bday' | 'cc-expiry-month' | 'cc-expiry-year' | 'cc-expiry'
A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### defaultView

value: `string`

Default month to display in `YYYY-MM` format.

This value is used until `view` is set, either directly or as a result of user interaction.

Defaults to the current month in the user's locale.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disallow

value: `string`

Dates that cannot be selected. These subtract from `allow`.

A comma-separated list of dates, date ranges. Whitespace is allowed after commas.

The default `''` has no effect on `allow`.

- Dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format disallow a single date.
- Dates in `YYYY-MM` format disallow a whole month.
- Dates in `YYYY` format disallow a whole year.
- Ranges are expressed as `start--end`.     - Ranges are inclusive.
    - If either `start` or `end` is omitted, the range is unbounded in that direction.
    - If parts of the date are omitted for `start`, they are assumed to be the minimum possible value.
      So `2024--` is equivalent to `2024-01-01--`.
    - If parts of the date are omitted for `end`, they are assumed to be the maximum possible value.
      So `--2024` is equivalent to `--2024-12-31`.
    - Whitespace is allowed either side of `--`.

### disallowDays

value: `string`

Days of the week that cannot be selected. This subtracts from `allowDays`, and intersects with the result of `allow` and `disallow`.

A comma-separated list of days. Whitespace is allowed after commas.

The default `''` has no effect on `allowDays`.

Days are `sunday`, `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### view

value: `string`

Displayed month in `YYYY-MM` format.

`onViewChange` is called when this value changes.

Defaults to `defaultView`.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Allow users to select a specific date with a date picker.

## DatePicker

### DatePicker

### __@dirtyStateSymbol@6941

value: `boolean`


### __@internals$1@6940

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### allow

value: `string`

Dates that can be selected.

A comma-separated list of dates, date ranges. Whitespace is allowed after commas.

The default `''` allows all dates.

- Dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format allow a single date.
- Dates in `YYYY-MM` format allow a whole month.
- Dates in `YYYY` format allow a whole year.
- Ranges are expressed as `start--end`.     - Ranges are inclusive.
    - If either `start` or `end` is omitted, the range is unbounded in that direction.
    - If parts of the date are omitted for `start`, they are assumed to be the minimum possible value.
      So `2024--` is equivalent to `2024-01-01--`.
    - If parts of the date are omitted for `end`, they are assumed to be the maximum possible value.
      So `--2024` is equivalent to `--2024-12-31`.
    - Whitespace is allowed either side of `--`.

### allowDays

value: `string`

Days of the week that can be selected. These intersect with the result of `allow` and `disallow`.

A comma-separated list of days. Whitespace is allowed after commas.

The default `''` has no effect on the result of `allow` and `disallow`.

Days are `sunday`, `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`.

### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

Default selected value.

The default means no date is selected.

If the provided value is invalid, no date is selected.

- If `type="single"`, this is a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- If `type="multiple"`, this is a comma-separated list of dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- If `type="range"`, this is a range in `YYYY-MM-DD--YYYY-MM-DD` format. The range is inclusive.

### defaultView

value: `string`

Default month to display in `YYYY-MM` format.

This value is used until `view` is set, either directly or as a result of user interaction.

Defaults to the current month in the user's locale.

### disallow

value: `string`

Dates that cannot be selected. These subtract from `allow`.

A comma-separated list of dates, date ranges. Whitespace is allowed after commas.

The default `''` has no effect on `allow`.

- Dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format disallow a single date.
- Dates in `YYYY-MM` format disallow a whole month.
- Dates in `YYYY` format disallow a whole year.
- Ranges are expressed as `start--end`.     - Ranges are inclusive.
    - If either `start` or `end` is omitted, the range is unbounded in that direction.
    - If parts of the date are omitted for `start`, they are assumed to be the minimum possible value.
      So `2024--` is equivalent to `2024-01-01--`.
    - If parts of the date are omitted for `end`, they are assumed to be the maximum possible value.
      So `--2024` is equivalent to `--2024-12-31`.
    - Whitespace is allowed either side of `--`.

### disallowDays

value: `string`

Days of the week that cannot be selected. This subtracts from `allowDays`, and intersects with the result of `allow` and `disallow`.

A comma-separated list of days. Whitespace is allowed after commas.

The default `''` has no effect on `allowDays`.

Days are `sunday`, `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### type

value: `"single" | "range"`


### value

value: `string`

Current selected value.

The default means no date is selected.

If the provided value is invalid, no date is selected.

Otherwise:

- If `type="single"`, this is a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- If `type="multiple"`, this is a comma-separated list of dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- If `type="range"`, this is a range in `YYYY-MM-DD--YYYY-MM-DD` format. The range is inclusive.

### view

value: `string`

Displayed month in `YYYY-MM` format.

`onViewChange` is called when this value changes.

Defaults to `defaultView`.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Allow users to select a specific date or date range.


### Basic usage

Demonstrates a date picker configured for selecting a single date with a default value and specific month view.```jsx
<s-date-picker
  type="single"
  name="delivery-date"
  value="2024-01-15"
  view="2024-01"
 />
```

```html
<s-date-picker
  type="single"
  name="delivery-date"
  value="2024-01-15"
  view="2024-01"
></s-date-picker>

```

  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-date-picker
  type="single"
  name="delivery-date"
  value="2024-01-15"
  view="2024-01"
 />) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Illustrates how to restrict date selection to a specific date range, preventing selection of past or future dates outside the allowed period.```jsx
<s-date-picker
  type="single"
  name="appointment-date"
  disallow="past"
  allow="2024-06-01--2024-06-31"
  view="2024-06"
 />
```

```html
<!-- Disable past dates and far future dates -->

  type="single"
  name="appointment-date"
  disallow="past"
  allow="2024-06-01--2024-06-31"
  view="2024-06"
></s-date-picker>

```

  type="single"
  name="appointment-date"
  disallow="past"
  allow="2024-06-01--2024-06-31"
  view="2024-06"
 />) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

# Divider

Create clear visual separation between elements in your user interface.

```jsx
<s-divider />
```

```html
<s-divider></s-divider>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>

## Properties

### Divider

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### color

value: `"base" | "strong"`

Modify the color to be more or less intense.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### direction

value: `"inline" | "block"`

Specify the direction of the divider. This uses [logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values).

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Create clear visual separation between elements in your user interface.

```jsx
<s-drop-zone
  label="Upload"
  accessibilityLabel="Upload image of type jpg, png, or gif"
  accept=".jpg,.png,.gif"
  multiple
  onInput={(event) => console.log('onInput', event.currentTarget?.value)}
  onChange={(event) => console.log('onChange', event.currentTarget?.value)}
  onDropRejected={(event) => console.log('onDropRejected', event.currentTarget?.value)}
 />
```

```html
<s-drop-zone

## Properties

### DropZone

### __@getFileInput@6978

value: `() => HTMLInputElement`


### __@internals@6977

value: `ElementInternals`


### __@setFiles@6976

value: `(files: File[]) => void`


### accept

value: `string`

A string representing the types of files that are accepted by the drop zone. This string is a comma-separated list of unique file type specifiers which can be one of the following:
- A file extension starting with a period (".") character (e.g. .jpg, .pdf, .doc)
- A valid MIME type string with no extensions

If omitted, all file types are accepted.

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the item. When set, it will be announced to buyers using assistive technologies and will provide them with more context.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### files

value: `File[]`

An array of File objects representing the files currently selected by the user.

This property is read-only and cannot be directly modified. To clear the selected files, set the `value` prop to an empty string or null.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### multiple

value: `boolean`

Whether multiple files can be selected or dropped at once.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

This sets the input value for a file type, which cannot be set programatically, so it can only be reset.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Lets users upload files through drag-and-drop functionality into a designated area on a page, or by activating a button.

## Properties

### EmailField

### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### autocomplete

value: `"on" | "off" | EmailAutocompleteField | `section-${string} email` | `section-${string} home email` | `section-${string} mobile email` | `section-${string} fax email` | `section-${string} pager email` | "shipping email" | "shipping home email" | "shipping mobile email" | "shipping fax email" | "shipping pager email" | "billing email" | "billing home email" | "billing mobile email" | "billing fax email" | "billing pager email" | `section-${string} shipping email` | `section-${string} shipping home email` | `section-${string} shipping mobile email` | `section-${string} shipping fax email` | `section-${string} shipping pager email` | `section-${string} billing email` | `section-${string} billing home email` | `section-${string} billing mobile email` | `section-${string} billing fax email` | `section-${string} billing pager email``

  - EmailAutocompleteField: 'email' | 'home email' | 'mobile email' | 'fax email' | 'pager email'
A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### maxLength

value: `number`

Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed.

### minLength

value: `number`

Specifies the min number of characters allowed.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

# Grid

Use `s-grid` to organize your content in a matrix of rows and columns and make responsive layouts for pages. Grid follows the same pattern as the [CSS grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).

```jsx
<s-grid
  gridTemplateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)"
  gap="small"
  justifyContent="center"
>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 2" border="base" borderStyle="dashed">
    Summary of sales
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 1" border="base" borderStyle="dashed">
    Orders
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="auto" border="base" borderStyle="dashed">
    Customers
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>
```

```html
<s-grid
  gridTemplateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)"
  gap="small"
  justifyContent="center"
>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 2" border="base" borderStyle="dashed">
    Summary of sales
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 1" border="base" borderStyle="dashed">

## Properties

### Grid

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the element. When set, it will be announced to users using assistive technologies and will provide them with more context.

Only use this when the element's content is not enough context for users using assistive technologies.

### accessibilityRole

value: `AccessibilityRole`

  - AccessibilityRole: 'main' | 'header' | 'footer' | 'section' | 'aside' | 'navigation' | 'ordered-list' | 'list-item' | 'list-item-separator' | 'unordered-list' | 'separator' | 'status' | 'alert' | 'generic' | 'presentation' | 'none'
Sets the semantic meaning of the component’s content. When set, the role will be used by assistive technologies to help users navigate the page.

### accessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "hidden" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the element.

- `visible`: the element is visible to all users.
- `hidden`: the element is removed from the accessibility tree but remains visible.
- `exclusive`: the element is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### alignContent

value: `"" | AlignContentKeyword`

  - AlignContentKeyword: 'normal' | BaselinePosition | ContentDistribution | OverflowPosition | ContentPosition
Aligns the grid along the block axis.

This overrides the block value of `placeContent`.

### alignItems

value: `"" | AlignItemsKeyword`

  - AlignItemsKeyword: 'normal' | 'stretch' | BaselinePosition | OverflowPosition | ContentPosition
Aligns the grid items along the block axis.

### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### background

value: `BackgroundColorKeyword`

  - BackgroundColorKeyword: 'transparent' | ColorKeyword

Adjust the [minimum inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-inline-size).

### overflow

value: `"visible" | "hidden"`

Sets the overflow behavior of the element.

- `hidden`: clips the content when it is larger than the element’s container. The element will not be scrollable and the users will not be able to access the clipped content by dragging or using a scroll wheel on a mouse.
- `visible`: the content that extends beyond the element’s container is visible.

### padding

value: `MaybeResponsive<MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

[1-to-4-value syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties#edges_of_a_box) is supported. Note that, contrary to the CSS, it uses flow-relative values and the order is:

- 4 values: `block-start inline-end block-end inline-start`
- 3 values: `block-start inline block-end`
- 2 values: `block inline`

For example:
- `large` means block-start, inline-end, block-end and inline-start paddings are `large`.

## Examples

Use `s-grid` to organize your content in a matrix of rows and columns and make responsive layouts for pages. Grid follows the same pattern as the [CSS grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).


### Basic usage

Simple 12-column grid system with equal-width left and right columns.```jsx
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

```html
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

The content of the Grid.

## Examples

Use `s-grid` to organize your content in a matrix of rows and columns and make responsive layouts for pages. Grid follows the same pattern as the [CSS grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).


### Basic usage

Simple 12-column grid system with equal-width left and right columns.```jsx
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

```html
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

## GridItem

Display content within a single item of a grid layout.

### GridItem

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the element. When set, it will be announced to users using assistive technologies and will provide them with more context.

Only use this when the element's content is not enough context for users using assistive technologies.

### accessibilityRole

value: `AccessibilityRole`

  - AccessibilityRole: 'main' | 'header' | 'footer' | 'section' | 'aside' | 'navigation' | 'ordered-list' | 'list-item' | 'list-item-separator' | 'unordered-list' | 'separator' | 'status' | 'alert' | 'generic' | 'presentation' | 'none'
Sets the semantic meaning of the component’s content. When set, the role will be used by assistive technologies to help users navigate the page.

### accessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "hidden" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the element.

- `visible`: the element is visible to all users.
- `hidden`: the element is removed from the accessibility tree but remains visible.
- `exclusive`: the element is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### background

value: `BackgroundColorKeyword`

  - BackgroundColorKeyword: 'transparent' | ColorKeyword
  - ColorKeyword: 'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
Adjust the background of the component.

### blockSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrAuto`

  - SizeUnitsOrAuto: SizeUnits | 'auto'
  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [block size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/block-size).

### border

value: `BorderShorthand`

  - BorderShorthand: BorderSizeKeyword | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword}` | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword} ${BorderStyleKeyword}`
Set the border via the shorthand property.

This can be a size, optionally followed by a color, optionally followed by a style.

If the color is not specified, it will be `base`.

If the style is not specified, it will be `auto`.

Values can be overridden by `borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, and `borderColor`.

### borderColor

value: `"" | ColorKeyword`

  - ColorKeyword: 'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
Adjust the color of the border.

### borderRadius

value: `MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<BoxBorderRadii>`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - BoxBorderRadii: 'small' | 'small-200' | 'small-100' | 'base' | 'large' | 'large-100' | 'large-200' | 'none'
Adjust the radius of the border.

### borderStyle

value: `"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<BoxBorderStyles>`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - BoxBorderStyles: 'auto' | 'none' | 'solid' | 'dashed'
Adjust the style of the border.

### borderWidth

value: `"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<"small" | "small-100" | "base" | "large" | "large-100" | "none">`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
Adjust the width of the border.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### display

value: `MaybeResponsive<"auto" | "none">`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
Sets the outer [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) type of the component. The outer type sets a component's participation in [flow layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout).

- `auto` the component's initial value. The actual value depends on the component and context.
- `none` hides the component from display and removes it from the accessibility tree, making it invisible to screen readers.

### gridColumn

value: `"auto" | `span ${number}``

Number of columns the item will span across

### gridRow

value: `"auto" | `span ${number}``

Number of rows the item will span across

### inlineSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrAuto`

  - SizeUnitsOrAuto: SizeUnits | 'auto'
  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inline-size).

### maxBlockSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrNone`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
  - SizeUnitsOrNone: SizeUnits | 'none'
Adjust the [maximum block size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-block-size).

### maxInlineSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrNone`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
  - SizeUnitsOrNone: SizeUnits | 'none'
Adjust the [maximum inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-inline-size).

### minBlockSize

value: `SizeUnits`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [minimum block size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-block-size).

### minInlineSize

value: `SizeUnits`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [minimum inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-inline-size).

### overflow

value: `"visible" | "hidden"`

Sets the overflow behavior of the element.

- `hidden`: clips the content when it is larger than the element’s container. The element will not be scrollable and the users will not be able to access the clipped content by dragging or using a scroll wheel on a mouse.
- `visible`: the content that extends beyond the element’s container is visible.

### padding

value: `MaybeResponsive<MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the padding of all edges.

[1-to-4-value syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties#edges_of_a_box) is supported. Note that, contrary to the CSS, it uses flow-relative values and the order is:

- 4 values: `block-start inline-end block-end inline-start`
- 3 values: `block-start inline block-end`
- 2 values: `block inline`

For example:
- `large` means block-start, inline-end, block-end and inline-start paddings are `large`.
- `large none` means block-start and block-end paddings are `large`, inline-start and inline-end paddings are `none`.
- `large none large` means block-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`, block-end padding is `large` and inline-start padding is `none`.
- `large none large small` means block-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`, block-end padding is `large` and inline-start padding is `small`.

A padding value of `auto` will use the default padding for the closest container that has had its usual padding removed.

`padding` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingBlock

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
  - MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}`
Adjust the block-padding.

- `large none` means block-start padding is `large`, block-end padding is `none`.

This overrides the block value of `padding`.

`paddingBlock` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingBlockEnd

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the block-end padding.

This overrides the block-end value of `paddingBlock`.

`paddingBlockEnd` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingBlockStart

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the block-start padding.

This overrides the block-start value of `paddingBlock`.

`paddingBlockStart` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingInline

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
  - MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}`
Adjust the inline padding.

- `large none` means inline-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`.

This overrides the inline value of `padding`.

`paddingInline` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingInlineEnd

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the inline-end padding.

This overrides the inline-end value of `paddingInline`.

`paddingInlineEnd` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### paddingInlineStart

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'

This overrides the inline-start value of `paddingInline`.

`paddingInlineStart` also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported PaddingKeyword as a query value.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;

## Examples

Use `s-grid` to organize your content in a matrix of rows and columns and make responsive layouts for pages. Grid follows the same pattern as the [CSS grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).


### Basic usage

Simple 12-column grid system with equal-width left and right columns.```jsx
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

```html
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

### children

value: `HTMLElement`

The content of the GridItem.

## Examples

Use `s-grid` to organize your content in a matrix of rows and columns and make responsive layouts for pages. Grid follows the same pattern as the [CSS grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).


### Basic usage

Simple 12-column grid system with equal-width left and right columns.```jsx
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

```html
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

## Examples

Use `s-grid` to organize your content in a matrix of rows and columns and make responsive layouts for pages. Grid follows the same pattern as the [CSS grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).


### Basic usage

Simple 12-column grid system with equal-width left and right columns.```jsx
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

```html
<s-grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(12, 1fr)" gap="base">
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Left column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
  <s-grid-item gridColumn="span 6" gridRow="span 1">
    <s-section>
      <s-text>Right column</s-text>
    </s-section>
  </s-grid-item>
</s-grid>

```

    </script>
</body>

# Heading

Renders hierarchical titles to communicate the structure and organization of page content. Heading levels adjust automatically based on nesting within parent Section components, ensuring a meaningful and accessible page outline.

## Properties

### Heading

### accessibilityRole

value: `"none" | "presentation" | "heading"`

Sets the semantic meaning of the component’s content. When set, the role will be used by assistive technologies to help users navigate the page.

- `heading`: defines the element as a heading to a page or section.
- `presentation`: the heading level will be stripped, and will prevent the element’s implicit ARIA semantics from being exposed to the accessibility tree.
- `none`: a synonym for the `presentation` role.

### accessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "hidden" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the element.

- `visible`: the element is visible to all users.
- `hidden`: the element is removed from the accessibility tree but remains visible.
- `exclusive`: the element is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### lineClamp

value: `number`

Truncates the text content to the specified number of lines.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Properties

### Icon

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### color

value: `"base" | "subdued"`

Modify the color to be more or less intense.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### interestFor

value: `string`

ID of a component that should respond to interest (e.g. hover and focus) on this component.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### size

value: `"small" | "base"`

Adjusts the size of the icon.

### tone

value: `"info" | "success" | "warning" | "critical" | "auto" | "neutral" | "caution"`

Sets the tone of the icon, based on the intention of the information being conveyed.

### type

value: `"" | "replace" | "search" | "split" | "link" | "edit" | "product" | "variant" | "collection" | "select" | "info" | "incomplete" | "complete" | "color" | "money" | "adjust" | "affiliate" |

## Properties

### Image

### accessibilityRole

value: `"none" | "presentation" | "img"`

Sets the semantic meaning of the component’s content. When set, the role will be used by assistive technologies to help users navigate the page.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### alt

value: `string`

An alternative text description that describe the image for the reader to understand what it is about. It is extremely useful for both users using assistive technology and sighted users. A well written description provides people with visual impairments the ability to participate in consuming non-text content. When a screen readers encounters an `s-image`, the description is read and announced aloud. If an image fails to load, potentially due to a poor connection, the `alt` is displayed on screen instead. This has the benefit of letting a sighted buyer know an image was meant to load here, but as an alternative, they’re still able to consume the text content. Read [considerations when writing alternative text](https://www.shopify.com/ca/blog/image-alt-text#4) to learn more.

### aspectRatio

value: ``${number}` | `${number}/${number}` | `${number}/ ${number}` | `${number} /${number}` | `${number} / ${number}``

The aspect ratio of the image.

The rendering of the image will depend on the `inlineSize` value:

- `inlineSize="fill"`: the aspect ratio will be respected and the image will take the necessary space.
- `inlineSize="auto"`: the image will not render until it has loaded and the aspect ratio will be ignored.

For example, if the value is set as `50 / 100`, the getter returns `50 / 100`. If the value is set as `0.5`, the getter returns `0.5 / 1`.

### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### border

value: `BorderShorthand`

  - BorderShorthand: BorderSizeKeyword | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword}` | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword} ${BorderStyleKeyword}`
Set the border via the shorthand property.

This can be a size, optionally followed by a color, optionally followed by a style.

If the color is not specified, it will be `base`.

If the style is not specified, it will be `auto`.

Values can be overridden by `borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, and `borderColor`.

### borderColor

value: `"" | ColorKeyword`

  - ColorKeyword: 'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
Adjust the color of the border.

### borderRadius

value: `MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<BoxBorderRadii>`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - BoxBorderRadii: 'small' | 'small-200' | 'small-100' | 'base' | 'large' | 'large-100' | 'large-200' | 'none'
Adjust the radius of the border.

### borderStyle

value: `"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<BoxBorderStyles>`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - BoxBorderStyles: 'auto' | 'none' | 'solid' | 'dashed'
Adjust the style of the border.

### borderWidth

value: `"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<"small" | "small-100" | "base" | "large" | "large-100" | "none">`

  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
Adjust the width of the border.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### inlineSize

value: `"auto" | "fill"`

The displayed inline width of the image.

- `fill`: the image will takes up 100% of the available inline size.
- `auto`: the image will be displayed at its natural size.

### loading

value: `"eager" | "lazy"`

Determines the loading behavior of the image:
- `eager`: Immediately loads the image, irrespective of its position within the visible viewport.
- `lazy`: Delays loading the image until it approaches a specified distance from the viewport.

### objectFit

value: `"contain" | "cover"`

Determines how the content of the image is resized to fit its container. The image is positioned in the center of the container.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### sizes

value: `string`

A set of media conditions and their corresponding sizes.

### src

value: `string`

The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).

When the image is loading or no `src` is provided, a placeholder will be rendered.

### srcSet

value: `string`

A set of image sources and their width or pixel density descriptors.

This overrides the `src` property.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

# Link

Makes text interactive, allowing users to navigate to other pages or perform specific actions. Supports standard URLs, custom protocols, and navigation within Shopify or app pages.

```jsx
<s-link href="javascript:void(0)">fufilling orders</s-link>
```

```html
<s-link href="#beep">fufilling orders</s-link>

```

## Properties

### Link

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the Link. It will be read to users using assistive technologies such as screen readers.

Use this when using only an icon or the content of the link is not enough context for users using assistive technologies.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### command

value: `'--auto' | '--show' | '--hide' | '--toggle'`

Sets the action the [command](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#command) should take when this clickable is activated.

See the documentation of particular components for the actions they support.

- `--auto`: a default action for the target component.
- `--show`: shows the target component.
- `--hide`: hides the target component.
- `--toggle`: toggles the target component.

### commandFor

value: `string`

Sets the element the [commandFor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#commandfor) should act on when this clickable is activated.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### download

value: `string`

Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download with the string being the file name. Download only works for same-origin URLs or the `blob:` and `data:` schemes.

### href

value: `string`

The URL to link to.

- If set, it will navigate to the location specified by `href` after executing the `click` event.
- If a `commandFor` is set, the `command` will be executed instead of the navigation.

### interestFor

value: `string`

Sets the element the [interestFor](https://open-ui.org/components/interest-invokers.explainer/#the-pitch-in-code) should act on when this clickable is activated.

### lang

value: `string`

Indicate the text language. Useful when the text is in a different language than the rest of the page. It will allow assistive technologies such as screen readers to invoke the correct pronunciation. [Reference of values](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) ("subtag" label)

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### target

value: `"auto" | AnyString | "_blank" | "_self" | "_parent" | "_top"`

  - AnyString: string & {}
Specifies where to display the linked URL.

### tone

value: `"critical" | "auto" | "neutral"`

Sets the tone of the Link, based on the intention of the information being conveyed.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Makes text interactive, allowing users to navigate to other pages or perform specific actions. Supports standard URLs, custom protocols, and navigation within Shopify or app pages.


### Basic usage

Links automatically inherit the tone from their surrounding paragraph context.```jsx
<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>
```

```html
<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Demonstrates links within subdued paragraph, showing how links can be used in less prominent paragraph contexts for additional guidance or support.```jsx
<s-paragraph color="subdued">
  Need help setting up shipping rates? <s-link>View shipping guide</s-link> or <s-link>contact merchant support</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>
```

```html
<s-paragraph color="subdued">
  Need help setting up shipping rates? <s-link href="javascript:void(0)" target="_blank">View shipping guide</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">contact merchant support</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>

```

</s-paragraph>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

## Examples

Makes text interactive, allowing users to navigate to other pages or perform specific actions. Supports standard URLs, custom protocols, and navigation within Shopify or app pages.


### Basic usage

Links automatically inherit the tone from their surrounding paragraph context.```jsx
<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>
```

```html
<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();

## Slots

### LinkSlots

### children

value: `HTMLElement`

The content of the Link.

## Examples

Makes text interactive, allowing users to navigate to other pages or perform specific actions. Supports standard URLs, custom protocols, and navigation within Shopify or app pages.


### Basic usage

Links automatically inherit the tone from their surrounding paragraph context.```jsx
<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>
```

```html
<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();

## Examples

Makes text interactive, allowing users to navigate to other pages or perform specific actions. Supports standard URLs, custom protocols, and navigation within Shopify or app pages.


### Basic usage

Links automatically inherit the tone from their surrounding paragraph context.```jsx
<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>
```

```html
<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-paragraph>
  Your product catalog is empty. Start by <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">adding your first product</s-link> or <s-link href="javascript:void(0)">importing existing inventory</s-link>.
</s-paragraph>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

## Properties

### Menu

### __@overlayActivator@7117

value: `HTMLElement`


### __@overlayHidden@7116

value: `boolean`


### __@overlayHideFrameId@7118

value: `number`


### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose or contents of the element. When set, it will be announced using assistive technologies and provide additional context.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Properties

### Modal

### __@abortController@7170

value: `AbortController`


### __@childrenRerenderObserver@7172

value: `MutationObserver`


### __@dialog@7164

value: `HTMLDialogElement`


### __@dismiss@7165

value: `() => void`

### __@hide@7162

value: `() => Promise<void>`


### __@isOpen@7163

value: `boolean`


### __@nestedModals@7168

value: `Map<Modal, boolean>`

  - Modal: declare class Modal extends PreactOverlayElement implements ModalProps {
  accessor accessibilityLabel: ModalProps['accessibilityLabel'];
  accessor heading: ModalProps['heading'];
  accessor padding: ModalProps['padding'];
  accessor size: ModalProps['size'];
  /** @private */
  [abortController]: AbortController;

}

### __@onBackdropClick@7169

value: `(event: MouseEvent) => void`


### __@onChildModalChange@7171

value: `EventListenerOrEventListenerObject`


### __@onEscape@7167

value: `(event: KeyboardEvent) => void`


### __@overlayActivator@7117

value: `HTMLElement`


### __@overlayHidden@7116

value: `boolean`


### __@overlayHideFrameId@7118

value: `number`


### __@shadowDomRerenderObserver@7173

value: `MutationObserver`


### __@show@7161

value: `() => Promise<void>`


### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose of the modal. When set, it will be announced to users using assistive technologies and will provide them with more context.

This overrides the `heading` prop for screen readers.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### heading

value: `string`

A title that describes the content of the Modal.

### hideOverlay

value: `() => void`

Method to hide an overlay.

### padding

value: `"base" | "none"`

Adjust the padding around the Modal content.

`base`: applies padding that is appropriate for the element.

`none`: removes all padding from the element. This can be useful when elements inside the Modal need to span to the edge of the Modal. For example, a full-width image. In this case, rely on `Box` with a padding of 'base' to bring back the desired padding for the rest of the content.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### showOverlay

value: `() => void`

Method to show an overlay.

### size

value: `"small" | "small-100" | "base" | "large" | "large-100"`

Adjust the size of the Modal.

### toggleOverlay

value: `() => void`

Method to toggle the visiblity of an overlay.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Displays content in an overlay. Use to create a distraction-free experience such as a confirmation dialog or a settings panel.

## Properties

### MoneyField

### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### autocomplete

value: `string`

A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### max

value: `number`

The highest decimal or integer to be accepted for the field. When used with `step` the value will round down to the max number.

Note: a user will still be able to use the keyboard to input a number higher than the max. It is up to the developer to add appropriate validation.

### min

value: `number`

The lowest decimal or integer to be accepted for the field. When used with `step` the value will round up to the min number.

Note: a user will still be able to use the keyboard to input a number lower than the min. It is up to the developer to add appropriate validation.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`


The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Collect monetary values from users with built-in currency formatting and validation.

## Properties

### NumberField

### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### autocomplete

value: `"on" | "off" | NumberAutocompleteField | `section-${string} one-time-code` | `section-${string} cc-number` | `section-${string} cc-csc` | "shipping one-time-code" | "shipping cc-number" | "shipping cc-csc" | "billing one-time-code" | "billing cc-number" | "billing cc-csc" | `section-${string} shipping one-time-code` | `section-${string} shipping cc-number` | `section-${string} shipping cc-csc` | `section-${string} billing one-time-code` | `section-${string} billing cc-number` | `section-${string} billing cc-csc``

  - NumberAutocompleteField: 'one-time-code' | 'cc-number' | 'cc-csc'
A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### inputMode

value: `"decimal" | "numeric"`

Sets the virtual keyboard.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### max

value: `number`

The highest decimal or integer to be accepted for the field. When used with `step` the value will round down to the max number.

Note: a user will still be able to use the keyboard to input a number higher than the max. It is up to the developer to add appropriate validation.

### min

value: `number`

The lowest decimal or integer to be accepted for the field. When used with `step` the value will round up to the min number.

Note: a user will still be able to use the keyboard to input a number lower than the min. It is up to the developer to add appropriate validation.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### prefix

value: `string`

A value to be displayed immediately before the editable portion of the field.

This is useful for displaying an implied part of the value, such as "https://" or "+353".

This cannot be edited by the user, and it isn't included in the value of the field.

It may not be displayed until the user has interacted with the input. For example, an inline label may take the place of the prefix until the user focuses the input.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### step

value: `number`

The amount the value can increase or decrease by. This can be an integer or decimal. If a `max` or `min` is specified with `step` when increasing/decreasing the value via the buttons, the final value will always round to the `max` or `min` rather than the closest valid amount.

### suffix

value: `string`

A value to be displayed immediately after the editable portion of the field.

This is useful for displaying an implied part of the value, such as "@shopify.com", or "%".

This cannot be edited by the user, and it isn't included in the value of the field.

It may not be displayed until the user has interacted with the input. For example, an inline label may take the place of the suffix until the user focuses the input.

### value

value: `string`


The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

Collect numerical values from users with optimized keyboard settings and built-in validation.

## ListItem

Represents a single item within an unordered or ordered list. Use only as a child of `s-unordered-list` or `s-ordered-list` components.

### ListItem

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

# Page

 Use `s-page` as the main container for placing content in your app. Page comes with preset layouts and automatically adds spacing between elements.

```jsx
<s-page heading="Products">
  <s-section>
    <s-text>Hello World</s-text>
  </s-section>
</s-page>
```

```html
<s-page heading="Products">
  <s-section>
    <s-text>Hello World</s-text>
  </s-section>
</s-page>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; padding: 0;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>

## Properties

Use as the outer wrapper of a page

### Page

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### heading

value: `string`

The main page heading

### inlineSize

value: `"small" | "base" | "large"`

The inline size of the page
- `base` corresponds to a set default inline size
- `large` full width with whitespace

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Examples

 Use `s-page` as the main container for placing content in your app. Page comes with preset layouts and automatically adds spacing between elements.


### Basic usage

Shows a page with a clear heading and descriptive text, illustrating how to use the page component with a title.```jsx
<s-page heading="Product catalog" inlineSize="base">
  <s-section>
    <s-text>Manage your product catalog and inventory.</s-text>
  </s-section>
</s-page>
```

```html
<s-page heading="Product catalog" inline-size="base">
  <s-section>
    <s-text>Manage your product catalog and inventory.</s-text>
  </s-section>
</s-page>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; padding: 0;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-page heading="Product catalog" inlineSize="base">
  <s-section>
    <s-text>Manage your product catalog and inventory.</s-text>
  </s-section>
</s-page>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Illustrates a page with a small inline size, ideal for focused, compact content like settings or forms with minimal information.```jsx
<s-page heading="Store settings" inlineSize="small">
  <s-section>
    <s-stack gap="base">
      <s-text>Configure your basic store preferences.</s-text>
      <s-text-field label="Store name" />
      <s-button variant="primary">Save</s-button>
    </s-stack>
  </s-section>
</s-page>
```

```html
<s-page heading="Store settings" inline-size="small">
  <s-section>
    <s-stack gap="base">
      <s-text>Configure your basic store preferences.</s-text>
      <s-text-field label="Store name"></s-text-field>
      <s-button variant="primary">Save</s-button>
    </s-stack>
  </s-section>
</s-page>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; padding: 0; min-height: 400px} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-page heading="Store settings" inlineSize="small">

      <s-text>Configure your basic store preferences.</s-text>
      <s-text-field label="Store name" />
      <s-button variant="primary">Save</s-button>
    </s-stack>
  </s-section>
</s-page>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Demonstrates a page with a large inline size, perfect for displaying broader content like analytics or dashboards with multiple information sections.```jsx
<s-page heading="Store analytics" inlineSize="large">

## Properties

### Paragraph

### accessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "hidden" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the element.

- `visible`: the element is visible to all users.
- `hidden`: the element is removed from the accessibility tree but remains visible.
- `exclusive`: the element is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### color

value: `"base" | "subdued"`

Modify the color to be more or less intense.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### dir

value: `"" | "auto" | "ltr" | "rtl"`

Indicates the directionality of the element’s text.

- `ltr`: languages written from left to right (e.g. English)
- `rtl`: languages written from right to left (e.g. Arabic)
- `auto`: the user agent determines the direction based on the content
- `''`: direction is inherited from parent elements (equivalent to not setting the attribute)

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### fontVariantNumeric

value: `"auto" | "normal" | "tabular-nums"`

Set the numeric properties of the font.

### lineClamp

value: `number`

Truncates the text content to the specified number of lines.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### tone

value: `"info" | "success" | "warning" | "critical" | "auto" | "neutral" | "caution"`

Sets the tone of the component, based on the intention of the information being conveyed.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Properties

### PasswordField

### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### autocomplete

value: `"on" | "off" | PasswordAutocompleteField | `section-${string} current-password` | `section-${string} new-password` | "shipping current-password" | "shipping new-password" | "billing current-password" | "billing new-password" | `section-${string} shipping current-password` | `section-${string} shipping new-password` | `section-${string} billing current-password` | `section-${string} billing new-password``

  - PasswordAutocompleteField: 'current-password' | 'new-password'
A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### maxLength

value: `number`

Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed.

### minLength

value: `number`

Specifies the min number of characters allowed.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Securely collect sensitive information from users.

<s-password-field
  label="Password"
  name="password"
  required
  minLength={8}
  autocomplete="new-password"
/>

```

```html
<s-password-field
  label="Password"
  name="password"
  required
  minLength="8"
  autocomplete="new-password"
></s-password-field>

```

## Properties

### Popover

### __@overlayActivator@7117

value: `HTMLElement`


### __@overlayHidden@7116

value: `boolean`


### __@overlayHideFrameId@7118

value: `number`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### blockSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrAuto`

  - SizeUnitsOrAuto: SizeUnits | 'auto'

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### inlineSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrAuto`

  - SizeUnitsOrAuto: SizeUnits | 'auto'
  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the inline size.

### maxBlockSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrNone`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
  - SizeUnitsOrNone: SizeUnits | 'none'
Adjust the maximum block size.

### maxInlineSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrNone`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
  - SizeUnitsOrNone: SizeUnits | 'none'
Adjust the maximum inline size.

### minBlockSize

value: `SizeUnits`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the minimum block size.

### minInlineSize

value: `SizeUnits`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the minimum inline size.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Popovers are used to display content in an overlay that can be triggered by a button.

# QueryContainer

Establishes a query container for responsive design. Use `s-query-container` to define an element as a containment context, enabling child components or styles to adapt based on the container’s size.

```jsx
<s-query-container>
  <s-box
    padding="@container (inline-size > 500px) large-500, none"
    background="strong"
  >
    Padding is applied when the inline-size > 500px
  </s-box>
</s-query-container>
```

```html
<s-query-container>
  <s-box
    padding="@container (inline-size > 500px) large-500, none"
    background="strong"
  >
    Padding is applied when the inline-size '>' 500px
  </s-box>
</s-query-container>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; padding: 0;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-query-container>
  <s-box
    padding="@container (inline-size > 500px) large-500, none"
    background="strong"
  >
    Padding is applied when the inline-size > 500px
  </s-box>
</s-query-container>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

## Properties

Use to define an element as a containment context, enabling child components or styles to adapt based on the container’s size.

### QueryContainer

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### containerName

value: `string`

The name of the container, which can be used in your container queries to target this container specifically.

We place the container name of `s-default` on every container. Because of this, it is not required to add a `containerName` identifier in your queries. For example, a `@container (inline-size <= 300px) none, auto` query is equivalent to `@container s-default (inline-size <= 300px) none, auto`.

Any value set in `containerName` will be set alongside alongside `s-default`. For example, `containerName="my-container-name"` will result in a value of `s-default my-container-name` set on the `container-name` CSS property of the rendered HTML.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

## Examples

Establishes a query container for responsive design. Use `s-query-container` to define an element as a containment context, enabling child components or styles to adapt based on the container’s size.


### Basic usage

Demonstrates the simplest way to use QueryContainer, wrapping content with a named container context.```jsx

A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### maxLength

value: `number`

Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed.

### minLength

value: `number`

Specifies the min number of characters allowed.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Let users enter search terms or find specific items using a single-line input field.

# Section

Groups related content into clearly-defined thematic areas. Sections have contextual styling that automatically adapts based on nesting depth. They also adjust heading levels to maintain a meaningful and accessible page structure.

</s-section>
```

```

## Properties

### Section

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label used to describe the section that will be announced by assistive technologies.

When no `heading` property is provided or included as a children of the Section, you **must** provide an `accessibilityLabel` to describe the Section. This is important as it allows assistive technologies to provide the right context to users.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### heading

value: `string`

A title that describes the content of the section.

### padding

value: `"base" | "none"`

Adjust the padding of all edges.

- `base`: applies padding that is appropriate for the element. Note that it may result in no padding if this is the right design decision in a particular context.
- `none`: removes all padding from the element. This can be useful when elements inside the Section need to span to the edge of the Section. For example, a full-width image. In this case, rely on `s-box` with a padding of 'base' to bring back the desired padding for the rest of the content.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Groups related content into clearly-defined thematic areas. Sections have contextual styling that automatically adapts based on nesting depth. They also adjust heading levels to maintain a meaningful and accessible page structure.


### Basic usage

Demonstrates a level 1 section with a heading and multiple form fields. This example shows how sections provide visual hierarchy and structure for input elements.```jsx
<s-section heading="Customer information">
  <s-text-field label="First name" value="John" />
  <s-text-field label="Last name" value="Doe" />
  <s-email-field label="Email" value="john@example.com" />
</s-section>
```

```html
<!-- Level 1 section - elevated with shadow on desktop -->
<s-section heading="Customer information">
  <s-text-field label="First name" value="John"></s-text-field>
  <s-text-field label="Last name" value="Doe"></s-text-field>
  <s-email-field label="Email" value="john@example.com"></s-email-field>
</s-section>

```

```preview

  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-section heading="Customer information">
  <s-text-field label="First name" value="John" />
  <s-text-field label="Last name" value="Doe" />
  <s-email-field label="Email" value="john@example.com" />
</s-section>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Illustrates how sections can be nested to create a hierarchical layout, with each nested section automatically adjusting its visual style. This example demonstrates the automatic visual leveling of nested sections.```jsx

## Examples

Groups related content into clearly-defined thematic areas. Sections have contextual styling that automatically adapts based on nesting depth. They also adjust heading levels to maintain a meaningful and accessible page structure.


### Basic usage

Demonstrates a level 1 section with a heading and multiple form fields. This example shows how sections provide visual hierarchy and structure for input elements.```jsx
<s-section heading="Customer information">
  <s-text-field label="First name" value="John" />
  <s-text-field label="Last name" value="Doe" />
  <s-email-field label="Email" value="john@example.com" />
</s-section>
```

```html
<!-- Level 1 section - elevated with shadow on desktop -->
<s-section heading="Customer information">
  <s-text-field label="First name" value="John"></s-text-field>
  <s-text-field label="Last name" value="Doe"></s-text-field>
  <s-email-field label="Email" value="john@example.com"></s-email-field>
</s-section>

```

  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-section heading="Customer information">
  <s-text-field label="First name" value="John" />
  <s-text-field label="Last name" value="Doe" />

</s-section>) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>

      </s-section>
    </s-section>

    {/* Another Level 2 section */}

## Properties

### Select

### __@hasInitialValueSymbol@7386

value: `boolean`


### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### __@usedFirstOptionSymbol@7385

value: `boolean`

used to determine if no value or defaultValue was set, in which case the first non-disabled option was used

this is important because we need to use the placeholder in these situations, even though the first value will be submitted as part of the form

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`

## Option

Represents a single option within a select component. Use only as a child of `s-select` components.

### Option

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - Option: declare class Option extends PreactCustomElement implements OptionProps {
  accessor selected: OptionProps['selected'];
  accessor defaultSelected: OptionProps['defaultSelected'];
  accessor value: OptionProps['value'];
  accessor disabled: OptionProps['disabled'];
  constructor();
}
  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultSelected

value: `boolean`

Whether the control is active by default.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the control, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### selected

value: `boolean`

Whether the control is active.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The value used in form data when the control is checked.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Allow users to pick one option from a menu. Ideal when presenting four or more choices to keep interfaces uncluttered.

## OptionGroup

Represents a group of options within a select component. Use only as a child of `s-select` components.

### OptionGroup

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disabled

value: `boolean`

Whether the options within this group can be selected or not.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### label

value: `string`

The user-facing label for this group of options.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Allow users to pick one option from a menu. Ideal when presenting four or more choices to keep interfaces uncluttered.

## Properties

### Spinner

### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label that describes the purpose of the progress. When set, it will be announced to users using assistive technologies and will provide them with more context. Providing an `accessibilityLabel` is recommended if there is no accompanying text describing that something is loading.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### size

value: `"base" | "large" | "large-100"`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Displays an animated indicator showing users that content or actions are loading. Use to communicate ongoing processes, such as fetching data from a server. For loading states on buttons, use the “loading” property on the Button component instead.

   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### columnGap

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | SpacingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - SpacingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust spacing between elements in the inline axis.

This overrides the column value of `gap`. `columnGap` either accepts:
- a single [SpacingKeyword](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#scale) value (e.g. `large-100`)
- OR a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported SpacingKeyword as a query value.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### direction

value: `MaybeResponsive<"inline" | "block">`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
Sets how the Stack's children are placed within the Stack.

`direction` either accepts:
- a single value either `inline` or `block`
- OR a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported SpacingKeyword as a query value.

value: `MaybeResponsive<"auto" | "none">`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
Sets the outer [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) type of the component. The outer type sets a component's participation in [flow layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout).

- `auto` the component's initial value. The actual value depends on the component and context.
- `none` hides the component from display and removes it from the accessibility tree, making it invisible to screen readers.

### gap

value: `MaybeResponsive<MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty<SpacingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}`
  - SpacingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust spacing between elements.

`gap` can either accept:
- a single [SpacingKeyword](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#scale) value applied to both axes (e.g. `large-100`)
- OR a pair of values (eg `large-100 large-500`) can be used to set the inline and block axes respectively
- OR a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/using-polaris-components#responsive-values) string with the supported SpacingKeyword as a query value.

### inlineSize

value: `SizeUnitsOrAuto`

  - SizeUnitsOrAuto: SizeUnits | 'auto'

value: `SizeUnits`

  - SizeUnits: `${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
Adjust the [minimum inline size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-inline-size).

### overflow

value: `"visible" | "hidden"`

Sets the overflow behavior of the element.

- `hidden`: clips the content when it is larger than the element’s container. The element will not be scrollable and the users will not be able to access the clipped content by dragging or using a scroll wheel on a mouse.
- `visible`: the content that extends beyond the element’s container is visible.

### padding

value: `MaybeResponsive<MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<PaddingKeyword>>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty: T | `${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T}` | `${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the padding of all edges.

[1-to-4-value syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties#edges_of_a_box) is supported. Note that, contrary to the CSS, it uses flow-relative values and the order is:

- 4 values: `block-start inline-end block-end inline-start`
- 3 values: `block-start inline block-end`
- 2 values: `block inline`

For example:
- `large` means block-start, inline-end, block-end and inline-start paddings are `large`.
- `large none` means block-start and block-end paddings are `large`, inline-start and inline-end paddings are `none`.
- `large none large` means block-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`, block-end padding is `large` and inline-start padding is `none`.
- `large none large small` means block-start padding is `large`, inline-end padding is `none`, block-end padding is `large` and inline-start padding is `small`.

A padding value of `auto` will use the default padding for the closest container that has had its usual padding removed.

### paddingBlockEnd

value: `MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>`

  - MaybeResponsive: T | `@container${string}`
  - PaddingKeyword: SizeKeyword | 'none'
Adjust the block-end padding.

## Examples

Organizes elements horizontally or vertically along the block or inline axis. Use to structure layouts, group related components, or control spacing between elements.


### Basic usage

Default vertical stacking layout with consistent spacing between text elements.```jsx
<s-stack gap="base">
  <s-text>First item</s-text>
  <s-text>Second item</s-text>
  <s-text>Third item</s-text>
</s-stack>
```

```html
<s-stack gap="base">
  <s-text>First item</s-text>
  <s-text>Second item</s-text>
  <s-text>Third item</s-text>
</s-stack>

```

```

Horizontal layout for arranging badges or similar elements side by side.```jsx
<s-stack direction="inline" gap="large-100">
  <s-badge>Item 1</s-badge>
  <s-badge>Item 2</s-badge>
  <s-badge>Item 3</s-badge>

## Properties

### Switch

### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### accessibilityLabel

value: `string`

A label used for users using assistive technologies like screen readers. When set, any children or `label` supplied will not be announced. This can also be used to display a control without a visual label, while still providing context to users using screen readers.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### checked

value: `boolean`

Whether the control is active.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultChecked

value: `boolean`

Whether the control is active by default.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### label

value: `string`

Visual content to use as the control label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The value used in form data when the checkbox is checked.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### Basic usage

Standard toggle switch for enabling or disabling merchant preferences. This example demonstrates a simple switch with a label, allowing users to toggle a single setting on or off.```jsx
<s-switch id="basic-switch" label="Enable notifications" />
```

```html
<s-switch id="basic-switch" label="Enable notifications"></s-switch>

```

```preview
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html, body {height:100%} body {box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0.5rem; display: grid; place-items: center; gap: 0.5rem;} </style> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/polaris.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/jsx-builder/jsx-builder.min.js"></script> </head>
  <body><s-box padding="base" id="wrapper-element"></s-box><script> (function() { const {render, h, Fragment, Component, useState} = window.preact; const jsxCode = `const App = () => { return (<s-switch id="basic-switch" label="Enable notifications" />) };`; try { const {code} = window.sucrase.transform(jsxCode, { transforms: ['jsx'], jsxPragma: 'h', jsxFragmentPragma: 'Fragment', production: true }); const fn = new Function('h', 'Fragment', 'Component', 'useState', code + '; return App;'); const App = fn(h, Fragment, Component, useState); const target = document.getElementById('wrapper-element') || document.body; if (target) render(h(App), target); } catch(e) { console.error('JSX Transform Error:', e); const body = document.body; if (body) body.innerHTML = '<div style="color:red;padding:1rem;">Error rendering example: ' + e.message + '</div>'; } })();
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Locked switch with explanatory text for unavailable premium features. This example shows a switch that is visually disabled and cannot be interacted with, typically used to indicate a feature is not currently available.```jsx
<s-switch
  id="disabled-switch"
  label="Feature locked (Premium plan required)"
  checked={true}
  disabled={true}
 />
```

```html
<s-switch
  id="disabled-switch"
  label="Feature locked (Premium plan required)"
  checked="true"
  disabled="true"
></s-switch>

```

Multiple switches within a form for notification preferences submission. This example illustrates how switches can be used together in a form to allow users to configure multiple related settings simultaneously.```jsx
<form>
  <s-switch
    id="email-notifications"
    label="Email notifications"
    name="emailNotifications"
    value="enabled"
   />
  <s-switch
    id="sms-notifications"
    label="SMS notifications"
    name="smsNotifications"
    value="enabled"
   />
</form>
```

```html
<form>
  <s-switch
    id="email-notifications"
    label="Email notifications"
    name="emailNotifications"

}
  - ListSlotType: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'kicker' | 'inline' | 'labeled'
  - HeaderFormat: 'base' | 'numeric' | 'currency'

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### hasNextPage

value: `boolean`

Whether there's an additional page of data.

### hasPreviousPage

value: `boolean`

Whether there's a previous page of data.

### loading

value: `boolean`

Whether the table is in a loading state, such as initial page load or loading the next page in a paginated table. When true, the table could be in an inert state, which prevents user interaction.

### paginate

value: `boolean`

Whether to use pagination controls.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### variant

value: `"auto" | "list"`

Sets the layout of the Table.

- `list`: The Table is always displayed as a list.
- `table`: The Table is always displayed as a table.
- `auto`: The Table is displayed as a table on wide devices and as a list on narrow devices.

### AddedContext

### addEventListener

value: `(type: string, callback: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | AddEventListenerOptions) => void`

The **`addEventListener()`** method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.

[MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

### dispatchEvent

value: `(event: Event) => boolean`

The **`dispatchEvent()`** method of the EventTarget sends an Event to the object, (synchronously) invoking the affected event listeners in the appropriate order.

[MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent)

### removeEventListener

value: `(type: string, callback: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject, options?: boolean | EventListenerOptions) => void`

The **`removeEventListener()`** method of the EventTarget interface removes an event listener previously registered with EventTarget.addEventListener() from the target.

[MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)

### value

value: `T`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## TableBody

Define the main content area of a table, containing rows and cells that display data.

### TableBody

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Examples

Display data clearly in rows and columns, helping users view, analyze, and compare information. Automatically renders as a list on small screens and a table on large ones.


### Basic usage

Tables expand to full width by default.```jsx

### Basic usage

Tables expand to full width by default.```jsx

## TableCell

Display data within a cell in a table row.

### TableCell

### __@headerFormatSymbol@7484

value: `HeaderFormat`

  - HeaderFormat: 'base' | 'numeric' | 'currency'

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Examples

Display data clearly in rows and columns, helping users view, analyze, and compare information. Automatically renders as a list on small screens and a table on large ones.

## TableHeader

Display column names at the top of a table.

### TableHeader

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### format

value: `HeaderFormat`

  - HeaderFormat: 'base' | 'numeric' | 'currency'
The format of the column. Will automatically apply styling and alignment to cell content based on the value.

- `base`: The base format for columns.
- `currency`: Formats the column as currency.
- `numeric`: Formats the column as a number.

### listSlot

value: `ListSlotType`

  - ListSlotType: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'kicker' | 'inline' | 'labeled'
Content designation for the table's `list` variant.

- `primary`: The most important content. Only one column can have this designation.
- `secondary`: The secondary content. Only one column can have this designation.
- `kicker`: Content that is displayed before primary and secondary content, but with less visual prominence. Only one column can have this designation.
- `inline`: Content that is displayed inline.
- `labeled`: Each column with this designation displays as a heading-content pair.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## TableHeaderRow

Define a header row in a table, displaying column names and enabling sorting.

### TableHeaderRow

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Examples

Display data clearly in rows and columns, helping users view, analyze, and compare information. Automatically renders as a list on small screens and a table on large ones.

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### clickDelegate

value: `string`

The ID of an interactive element (e.g. `s-link`) in the row that will be the target of the click when the row is clicked. This is the primary action for the row; it should not be used for secondary actions.

This is a click-only affordance, and does not introduce any keyboard or screen reader affordances. Which is why the target element must be in the table; so that keyboard and screen reader users can interact with it normally.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Examples

Display data clearly in rows and columns, helping users view, analyze, and compare information. Automatically renders as a list on small screens and a table on large ones.

## Examples

Display data clearly in rows and columns, helping users view, analyze, and compare information. Automatically renders as a list on small screens and a table on large ones.


### Basic usage

Tables expand to full width by default.```jsx

      <s-table-header listSlot="labeled">Inventory</s-table-header>
      <s-table-header listSlot="labeled">Price</s-table-header>
    </s-table-header-row>

## Properties

### Text

### accessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "hidden" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the element.

- `visible`: the element is visible to all users.
- `hidden`: the element is removed from the accessibility tree but remains visible.
- `exclusive`: the element is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### color

value: `"base" | "subdued"`

Modify the color to be more or less intense.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### dir

value: `"" | "auto" | "ltr" | "rtl"`

Indicates the directionality of the element’s text.

- `ltr`: languages written from left to right (e.g. English)
- `rtl`: languages written from right to left (e.g. Arabic)
- `auto`: the user agent determines the direction based on the content
- `''`: direction is inherited from parent elements (equivalent to not setting the attribute)

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### fontVariantNumeric

value: `"auto" | "normal" | "tabular-nums"`

Set the numeric properties of the font.

### interestFor

value: `string`

ID of a component that should respond to interest (e.g. hover and focus) on this component.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### tone

value: `"info" | "success" | "warning" | "critical" | "auto" | "neutral" | "caution"`

Sets the tone of the component, based on the intention of the information being conveyed.

### type

value: `"strong" | "generic" | "address" | "redundant"`

Provide semantic meaning and default styling to the text.

Other presentation properties on Text override the default styling.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Displays inline text with specific visual styles or tones. Use to emphasize or differentiate words or phrases within a Paragraph or other block-level components.

A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### maxLength

value: `number`

Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed.

### minLength

value: `number`

Specifies the min number of characters allowed.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### rows

value: `number`

A number of visible text lines.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`

  - AnyString: string & {}
The type of icon to be displayed in the field.

### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### maxLength

value: `number`

Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed.

### minLength

value: `number`

Specifies the min number of characters allowed.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### prefix

value: `string`

A value to be displayed immediately before the editable portion of the field.

This is useful for displaying an implied part of the value, such as "https://" or "+353".

This cannot be edited by the user, and it isn't included in the value of the field.

It may not be displayed until the user has interacted with the input. For example, an inline label may take the place of the prefix until the user focuses the input.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### suffix

value: `string`

A value to be displayed immediately after the editable portion of the field.

This is useful for displaying an implied part of the value, such as "@shopify.com", or "%".

This cannot be edited by the user, and it isn't included in the value of the field.

It may not be displayed until the user has interacted with the input. For example, an inline label may take the place of the suffix until the user focuses the input.

### value

value: `string`

The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Lets users enter or edit text within a single-line input. Use to collect short, free-form information from users.


### Basic usage

Demonstrates a simple text input field for entering a store name with autocomplete turned off, providing a clean and straightforward input experience.```jsx
<s-text-field label="Store name" autocomplete="off" />
```

```html
<s-text-field label="Store name" autocomplete="off"></s-text-field>

```

## Properties

### Thumbnail

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### alt

value: `string`

An alternative text description that describe the image for the reader to understand what it is about. It is extremely useful for both users using assistive technology and sighted users. A well written description provides people with visual impairments the ability to participate in consuming non-text content. When a screen readers encounters an `s-image`, the description is read and announced aloud. If an image fails to load, potentially due to a poor connection, the `alt` is displayed on screen instead. This has the benefit of letting a sighted buyer know an image was meant to load here, but as an alternative, they’re still able to consume the text content. Read [considerations when writing alternative text](https://www.shopify.com/ca/blog/image-alt-text#4) to learn more.

### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### size

value: `"small" | "small-200" | "small-100" | "base" | "large" | "large-100"`

Adjusts the size the product thumbnail image.

### src

value: `string`

The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).

When the image is loading or no `src` is provided, a placeholder will be rendered.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`


## Examples

Display a small preview image representing content, products, or media.

## URLField

### URLField

### __@internals$4@6742

value: `ElementInternals`


### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### autocomplete

value: `"on" | "off" | `section-${string} url` | `section-${string} photo` | `section-${string} impp` | `section-${string} home impp` | `section-${string} mobile impp` | `section-${string} fax impp` | `section-${string} pager impp` | "shipping url" | "shipping photo" | "shipping impp" | "shipping home impp" | "shipping mobile impp" | "shipping fax impp" | "shipping pager impp" | "billing url" | "billing photo" | "billing impp" | "billing home impp" | "billing mobile impp" | "billing fax impp" | "billing pager impp" | `section-${string} shipping url` | `section-${string} shipping photo` | `section-${string} shipping impp` | `section-${string} shipping home impp` | `section-${string} shipping mobile impp` | `section-${string} shipping fax impp` | `section-${string} shipping pager impp` | `section-${string} billing url` | `section-${string} billing photo` | `section-${string} billing impp` | `section-${string} billing home impp` | `section-${string} billing mobile impp` | `section-${string} billing fax impp` | `section-${string} billing pager impp` | URLAutocompleteField`

  - URLAutocompleteField: 'url' | 'photo' | 'impp' | 'home impp' | 'mobile impp' | 'fax impp' | 'pager impp'
A hint as to the intended content of the field.

When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### defaultValue

value: `string`

The default value for the field.

### details

value: `string`

Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

### disabled

value: `boolean`

Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### error

value: `string`

Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

### formResetCallback

value: `() => void`


### getAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => string`

Global keyboard event handlers for things like key bindings typically ignore keystrokes originating from within input elements. Unfortunately, these never account for a Custom Element being the input element.

To fix this, we spoof getAttribute & hasAttribute to make a PreactFieldElement appear as a contentEditable "input" when it contains a focused input element.

### hasAttribute

value: `(qualifiedName: string) => boolean`


### id

value: `string`

A unique identifier for the element.

### isContentEditable

value: `boolean`

Checks if the shadow tree contains a focused input (input, textarea, select, <x contentEditable>). Note: this does _not_ return true for focussed non-field form elements like buttons.

### label

value: `string`

Content to use as the field label.

### labelAccessibilityVisibility

value: `"visible" | "exclusive"`

Changes the visibility of the component's label.

- `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
- `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

### maxLength

value: `number`

Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed.

### minLength

value: `number`

Specifies the min number of characters allowed.

### name

value: `string`

An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

### placeholder

value: `string`

A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### readOnly

value: `boolean`

The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

### required

value: `boolean`

Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### value

value: `string`

The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.

### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

Demonstrates a simple URL input field with a label and placeholder, showing the minimal configuration needed for collecting a URL.```jsx
<s-stack gap="base">
  {/* Simple URL input */}
  <s-url-field
    label="Website URL"
    placeholder="https://example.com"
   />
</s-stack>
```

```html
<s-stack gap="base">
  <!-- Simple URL input -->
  <s-url-field
    label="Website URL"
    placeholder="https://example.com"
  ></s-url-field>
</s-stack>

## ListItem

Represents a single item within an unordered or ordered list. Use only as a child of `s-unordered-list` or `s-ordered-list` components.

### ListItem

### adoptedCallback

value: `() => void`


### attributeChangedCallback

value: `(name: string) => void`


### click

value: `({ sourceEvent }?: ClickOptions) => void`

  - ClickOptions: export interface ClickOptions {
  /**
   * The event you want to influence the synthetic click.
   */
  sourceEvent?: ActivationEventEsque;
}
Like the standard `element.click()`, but you can influence the behavior with a `sourceEvent`.

For example, if the `sourceEvent` was a middle click, or has particular keys held down, components will attempt to produce the desired behavior on links, such as opening the page in the background tab.

### connectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### disconnectedCallback

value: `() => void`


### queueRender

value: `() => void`

Queue a run of the render function. You shouldn't need to call this manually - it should be handled by changes to

### setAttribute

value: `(name: string, value: string) => void`


### ClickOptions

### sourceEvent

value: `ActivationEventEsque`

  - ActivationEventEsque: export interface ActivationEventEsque {
  shiftKey: boolean;
  metaKey: boolean;
  ctrlKey: boolean;
  button: number;
}
The event you want to influence the synthetic click.

### ActivationEventEsque

### button

value: `number`


### ctrlKey

value: `boolean`


### metaKey

value: `boolean`


### shiftKey

value: `boolean`

## Account connection

The account connection component is used so merchants can connect or disconnect their store to various accounts. For example, if merchants want to use the Facebook sales channel, they need to connect their Facebook account to their Shopify store.

  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Display connection status | Show if a sales channel is connected or disconnected |
  | Allow merchants to disconnect accounts  | Enable merchants to disconnect from a marketing platform |

  ---
  

  

[View Account connection](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/account-connection)

## App card

App cards provide a consistent layout for presenting another app to merchants. They are used to highlight apps that can extend functionality or help merchants accomplish related tasks. App cards should educate merchants about the value of the suggested app and provide a clear, actionable way to learn more or install it.

  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Suggest complementary apps | Recommend an email marketing app to subscription service users |
  | Promote integrations | Highlight a social media scheduler that connects with your app |
  | Guide merchants to explore new solutions | Introduce a reporting tool for advanced analytics |

  ---
  

  

[View App card](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/app-card)

## Callout card

Callout cards are used to encourage merchants to take an action related to a new feature or opportunity. They are most commonly displayed in the sales channels section of Shopify.
 
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Promote new features or integrations | Dismissible feature announcement |
  | Drive adoption of app functionality | Common first actions |
  ---

[View Callout card](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/callout-card)

## Details

The details page allows merchants to view, create and edit objects. Use the right column to provide editable fields, and the right column for supporting information such as status, metadata, and summaries.
 
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | View, edit and create objects  | Discounts, shipping labels, newsletters, templates. |

  ![Preview of the details page pattern](/assets/templated-apis-screenshots/admin/patterns/details-example.png)

  This pattern uses `Badge`, `Box`, `Button`, `Grid`, `Heading`, `Image`, `Link`, `MoneyField`, `NumberField`, `SearchField`, `Section`, `Select`, `Stack`, `Switch`, `Table`, `TextArea`, `TextField`, `UnorderedList`, and `URLField` components.

  ---

  ## Design guidelines
  Design details pages that enable users to create, view, and edit resource objects.

  ### Navigation

  * Users must be able to return to the previous page without using the browser button. To achieve this, your app can provide breadcrumbs or a Back button on the page.
  * Use tabs sparingly for secondary navigation purposes when the nav menu isn't sufficient.
    * Clicking a tab should only change the content below it, not above.
    * Tabs should never wrap onto multiple lines.
    * Navigating between tabs shouldn't cause the tabs to change position or move.
    * Offer users clear and predictable action labels.

  ---

  ### Layout

  * Design your app to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.
  * Use looser spacing for low-density layouts. Use tighter spacing for high-density layouts.
  * Always use the default width. Full width tends to waste space and make the page harder to parse
  * In the primary column: Put information that defines the resource object
  * In the secondary column: Put supporting information such as status, metadata, and summaries
  * Arrange content in order of importance
  * Group similar content in the same card
  * Place unique page actions at the top of the actions list and typical object actions at the bottom

  ---

  ### Forms

  * For more than five inputs, use sections with titles in one card or use multiple cards with headers.
  * Form inputs should be saved using the App Bridge Contextual Save Bar API. This also applies to forms within max modals. Continuous data validation or auto-save for forms is consistent with the standard Shopify admin save UX.

  ---

  <style>
    div[class*="CodeBlock-module-CodeBlock_"] {
      max-height: calc(100vh - 80px) !important;
    }
    div[class*="Tabs-module-TabsContent_"] {
      overflow: auto !important;
    }
    div[class*="Screenshot-module-Screenshot_"] {
      display: none !important;
    }
  </style>
[View Details](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/details)

## Empty state

Empty states are used when a list, table, or chart has no items or data to show. This is an opportunity to provide explanation or guidance to help merchants progress. The empty state component is intended for use when a full page in the admin is empty, and not for individual elements or areas in the interface.

  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Offer a clear next step when no data is present | Prompt merchants to create their first campaign |
  | Encourage activation of features | Suggest setting up a subscription plan when none exist |
  ---

[View Empty state](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/empty-state)

## Homepage

The app URL specified in the Partner Dashboard should point to your app homepage. The home page of your app is the first thing merchants will see, and it should provide daily value to them. Design the page to provide status updates and show merchants what actions they can take.
 
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Teach merchants how to use the app | Onboarding, how-to guides |
  | Display app functionalities | Call-to-actions to app features, resource tables |
  | Show updates | Status banners, company news |

  ![Preview of the homepage pattern](/assets/templated-apis-screenshots/admin/patterns/homepage-example.png)

  This pattern uses `Badge`, `Banner`, `Box`, `Button`, `Checkbox`, `Clickable`, `Divider`, `Grid`, `Heading`, `Image`, `Link`, `Paragraph`, `Section`, `Stack`, and `Text` components.

  ---

  ## Design guidelines
  Your app home page should be designed to provide users with relevant, timely information like quick statistics, status updates, or information that’s immediately actionable.

  ### Onboarding

  The onboarding experience quickly introduces users to your app's essential features. A good onboarding should be self-guided, easy to follow and make users feel they understand how the app works after finishing it. If the onboarding is long or complex, give users the option to complete it at a later time to avoid stopping their workflow.

  * Onboarding must be brief and direct. Provide clear instructions and guide users to completion
  * Only request information from users if it's necessary
  * If your onboarding isn't essential, then make it dismissible
  * Don't have more than five steps in your onboarding process. This can lead users to drop off and not use your app

  ---

  ### Visual design

  * Design your app to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.
  * Use looser spacing for low-density layouts. Use tighter spacing for high-density layouts.
  * Use high-resolution photos and images to ensure a professional, high-quality experience.

      display: none !important;
    }
  </style>
[View Homepage](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/homepage)

## Index

The index layout lets merchants view and manage all their objects at once in a table format. They can filter, sort and do quick actions on their objects. To prevent tables from becoming visually cluttered, reveal actions only when the row is hovered over or selected

  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | View all objects at once | Products, orders, customers, discounts |
  | Perform bulk actions | Delete products, pause/activate campaigns |

  ![Preview of the index pattern](/assets/templated-apis-screenshots/admin/patterns/index-example.png)

  This pattern uses `Badge`, `Box`, `Button`, `Clickable`, `Grid`, `Heading`, `Image`, `Link`, `Paragraph`, `Section`, `Stack`, and `Table` components.

  ---

  ## Design guidelines
  Design your index page so users can organize and take action on resource objects.

  ### Navigation

  * Users must be able to return to the previous page without using the browser button. To achieve this, your app can provide breadcrumbs or a Back button on the page.
  * Offer users clear and predictable action labels.

  ---

  ### Layout

  * Design your app to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.
  * For resource index pages, use a full-width page. This is helpful when users are dealing with lists of data that have many columns.

  ---

  <style>
          div[class*="CodeBlock-module-CodeBlock_"] {
        max-height: calc(100vh - 400px) !important;
    }
    div[class*="Tabs-module-TabsContent_"] {
      overflow: auto !important;
    }
    div[class*="Screenshot-module-Screenshot_"] {
      display: none !important;
    }
  </style>
[View Index](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/index)

## Index table

An index table displays a collection of objects of the same type, like orders or products. The main job of an index table is to help merchants get an at-a-glance of the objects to perform actions or navigate to a full-page representation of it.
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Display collections of similar objects | Products, orders, customers, discounts |
  | Perform bulk actions | Delete products, pause/activate campaigns |
  ---

  
[View Index table](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/index-table)

## Interstitial nav

Interstitial navigation is used to connect merchants to deeper pages—such as settings, features, or resources—within a section of your app. It helps keep navigation clean and focused by avoiding multiple nested items, making it easier for merchants to discover and access important functionality.
 
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Link to individual settings pages | Navigate from a settings overview to product settings or notification preferences |
  | Connect to feature-specific pages | Direct merchants from campaign overview to reporting or automation setup |
  | Guide merchants to supporting resources | Link to help documentation or integration guides from a central section |
  | Simplify navigation structure | Reduce clutter by providing access to deeper pages without multi-level menus |
  ---

[View Interstitial nav](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/interstitial-nav)

## Media card

Media cards provide a consistent layout to present visual information to merchants. Visual media is used to provide additional context to the written information it's paired with.

  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Educate merchants on key actions | Show how to connect a social account with a demo image |
  | Provide clear calls to action | Show campaign preview with a "Send campaign" button |

  ---
  

  

[View Media card](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/media-card)

## Metrics card

Metrics cards are used to highlight important numbers, statistics, or trends from your app, so merchants can quickly understand their activity and performance.
  
  
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Show app-specific metrics | Email open rates, active subscribers |
  | Visualize user engagement | Social media followers, campaign clicks |
  ---

[View Metrics card](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/patterns/metrics-card)

## Settings

Make settings pages easy to scan by grouping related information in a logical order. For complex or lengthy settings, organize content into distinct, themed sections that link to their own pages.
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Find and change app settings | Membership settings, app appearance, set up theme blocks |

  ![Preview of the settings pattern](/assets/templated-apis-screenshots/admin/patterns/settings-example.png)

  This pattern uses `Box`, `Button`, `ChoiceList`, `Clickable`, `Divider`, `Grid`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Paragraph`, `Section`, `Select`, `Stack`, and `TextField` components.

  ---

  ## Design guidelines
  Design scannable settings pages with groups of related information placed in logical order.

  ### Navigation

  * Users must be able to return to the previous page without using the browser button. To achieve this, your app can provide breadcrumbs or a Back button on the page.
  * Offer users clear and predictable action labels.

  ---

  ### Visual design

  Design your app to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.

  * Use looser spacing for low-density layouts. Use tighter spacing for high-density layouts.
  * Use high-resolution photos and images to ensure a professional, high-quality experience.

# App card

App cards provide a consistent layout for presenting another app to merchants. They are used to highlight apps that can extend functionality or help merchants accomplish related tasks. App cards should educate merchants about the value of the suggested app and provide a clear, actionable way to learn more or install it.

  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Suggest complementary apps | Recommend an email marketing app to subscription service users |
  | Promote integrations | Highlight a social media scheduler that connects with your app |
  | Guide merchants to explore new solutions | Introduce a reporting tool for advanced analytics |

# Details

The details page allows merchants to view, create and edit objects. Use the right column to provide editable fields, and the right column for supporting information such as status, metadata, and summaries.
 
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | View, edit and create objects  | Discounts, shipping labels, newsletters, templates. |

  ![Preview of the details page pattern](/assets/templated-apis-screenshots/admin/patterns/details-example.png)

  This pattern uses `Badge`, `Box`, `Button`, `Grid`, `Heading`, `Image`, `Link`, `MoneyField`, `NumberField`, `SearchField`, `Section`, `Select`, `Stack`, `Switch`, `Table`, `TextArea`, `TextField`, `UnorderedList`, and `URLField` components.

  ---

  ## Design guidelines
  Design details pages that enable users to create, view, and edit resource objects.

  ### Navigation

  * Users must be able to return to the previous page without using the browser button. To achieve this, your app can provide breadcrumbs or a Back button on the page.
  * Use tabs sparingly for secondary navigation purposes when the nav menu isn't sufficient.
    * Clicking a tab should only change the content below it, not above.
    * Tabs should never wrap onto multiple lines.
    * Navigating between tabs shouldn't cause the tabs to change position or move.
    * Offer users clear and predictable action labels.

  ---

  ### Layout

  * Design your app to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.
  * Use looser spacing for low-density layouts. Use tighter spacing for high-density layouts.
  * Always use the default width. Full width tends to waste space and make the page harder to parse
  * In the primary column: Put information that defines the resource object
  * In the secondary column: Put supporting information such as status, metadata, and summaries
  * Arrange content in order of importance
  * Group similar content in the same card
  * Place unique page actions at the top of the actions list and typical object actions at the bottom

  ---

  ### Forms

  * For more than five inputs, use sections with titles in one card or use multiple cards with headers.
  * Form inputs should be saved using the App Bridge Contextual Save Bar API. This also applies to forms within max modals. Continuous data validation or auto-save for forms is consistent with the standard Shopify admin save UX.

# Empty state

Empty states are used when a list, table, or chart has no items or data to show. This is an opportunity to provide explanation or guidance to help merchants progress. The empty state component is intended for use when a full page in the admin is empty, and not for individual elements or areas in the interface.

  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Offer a clear next step when no data is present | Prompt merchants to create their first campaign |
  | Encourage activation of features | Suggest setting up a subscription plan when none exist |

# Homepage

The app URL specified in the Partner Dashboard should point to your app homepage. The home page of your app is the first thing merchants will see, and it should provide daily value to them. Design the page to provide status updates and show merchants what actions they can take.
 
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Teach merchants how to use the app | Onboarding, how-to guides |
  | Display app functionalities | Call-to-actions to app features, resource tables |
  | Show updates | Status banners, company news |

  ![Preview of the homepage pattern](/assets/templated-apis-screenshots/admin/patterns/homepage-example.png)

  This pattern uses `Badge`, `Banner`, `Box`, `Button`, `Checkbox`, `Clickable`, `Divider`, `Grid`, `Heading`, `Image`, `Link`, `Paragraph`, `Section`, `Stack`, and `Text` components.

  ---

  ## Design guidelines
  Your app home page should be designed to provide users with relevant, timely information like quick statistics, status updates, or information that’s immediately actionable.

  ### Onboarding

  The onboarding experience quickly introduces users to your app's essential features. A good onboarding should be self-guided, easy to follow and make users feel they understand how the app works after finishing it. If the onboarding is long or complex, give users the option to complete it at a later time to avoid stopping their workflow.

  * Onboarding must be brief and direct. Provide clear instructions and guide users to completion
  * Only request information from users if it's necessary
  * If your onboarding isn't essential, then make it dismissible
  * Don't have more than five steps in your onboarding process. This can lead users to drop off and not use your app

  ---

  ### Visual design

  * Design your app to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.
  * Use looser spacing for low-density layouts. Use tighter spacing for high-density layouts.
  * Use high-resolution photos and images to ensure a professional, high-quality experience.

# Index

The index layout lets merchants view and manage all their objects at once in a table format. They can filter, sort and do quick actions on their objects. To prevent tables from becoming visually cluttered, reveal actions only when the row is hovered over or selected

  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | View all objects at once | Products, orders, customers, discounts |
  | Perform bulk actions | Delete products, pause/activate campaigns |

  ![Preview of the index pattern](/assets/templated-apis-screenshots/admin/patterns/index-example.png)

  This pattern uses `Badge`, `Box`, `Button`, `Clickable`, `Grid`, `Heading`, `Image`, `Link`, `Paragraph`, `Section`, `Stack`, and `Table` components.

  ---

  ## Design guidelines
  Design your index page so users can organize and take action on resource objects.

  ### Navigation

  * Users must be able to return to the previous page without using the browser button. To achieve this, your app can provide breadcrumbs or a Back button on the page.
  * Offer users clear and predictable action labels.

  ---

  ### Layout

  * Design your app to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.
  * For resource index pages, use a full-width page. This is helpful when users are dealing with lists of data that have many columns.

# Index table

An index table displays a collection of objects of the same type, like orders or products. The main job of an index table is to help merchants get an at-a-glance of the objects to perform actions or navigate to a full-page representation of it.
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Display collections of similar objects | Products, orders, customers, discounts |
  | Perform bulk actions | Delete products, pause/activate campaigns |

# Interstitial nav

Interstitial navigation is used to connect merchants to deeper pages—such as settings, features, or resources—within a section of your app. It helps keep navigation clean and focused by avoiding multiple nested items, making it easier for merchants to discover and access important functionality.
 
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Link to individual settings pages | Navigate from a settings overview to product settings or notification preferences |
  | Connect to feature-specific pages | Direct merchants from campaign overview to reporting or automation setup |
  | Guide merchants to supporting resources | Link to help documentation or integration guides from a central section |
  | Simplify navigation structure | Reduce clutter by providing access to deeper pages without multi-level menus |

# Settings

Make settings pages easy to scan by grouping related information in a logical order. For complex or lengthy settings, organize content into distinct, themed sections that link to their own pages.
  | Used to | Examples |
  | --- | --- |
  | Find and change app settings | Membership settings, app appearance, set up theme blocks |

  ![Preview of the settings pattern](/assets/templated-apis-screenshots/admin/patterns/settings-example.png)

  This pattern uses `Box`, `Button`, `ChoiceList`, `Clickable`, `Divider`, `Grid`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Paragraph`, `Section`, `Select`, `Stack`, and `TextField` components.

  ---

  ## Design guidelines
  Design scannable settings pages with groups of related information placed in logical order.

  ### Navigation

  * Users must be able to return to the previous page without using the browser button. To achieve this, your app can provide breadcrumbs or a Back button on the page.
  * Offer users clear and predictable action labels.

  ---

  ### Visual design

  Design your app to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a seamless user experience across various platforms.

  * Use looser spacing for low-density layouts. Use tighter spacing for high-density layouts.
  * Use high-resolution photos and images to ensure a professional, high-quality experience.
